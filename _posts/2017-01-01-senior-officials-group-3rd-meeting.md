<p>Complete</p>
<p><strong>3.  Draft Open Data Strategies and Emerging Themes</strong></p>
<ul><li>Charlotte Alldritt thanked the group for submitting their draft Open Data strategies.</li>
<li>The draft strategies are of a good standard, reflecting new ways for gathering and analysing user feedback, and the continued efforts to drive up data quality.</li>
<li>The deadline for publication of departmental business plans has been changed to the 14th May 2012 therefore the Transparency Team has moved the timetable for Open Data strategies.</li>
<li>A second substantive draft is required by 21st March. The Account Managers in the Transparency Team will work with their departments on any additional revisions. </li>
<li>The final version will need to be submitted by 30th April 2012.</li>
<li>The Right to Data White Paper will be published at the end of May. Departmental Open Data strategies will be included as an annex.</li>
<li>One theme that is common to all the strategies that have been received is that departments need to be clearer on ‘how’ they will deliver. The strategies are very good at describing what Transparency will change about the way departments do things but there needs to be more detail on how it will do so.</li>
<li>In addition departments need to be clear on what they can realistically achieve in the two year period the Open Data strategy covers.</li>
<li>Senior Officials suggested that in departments which have limited interaction with the public, it is difficult to assess what data/information might be of interest and/or use.</li>
<li>Departments should use the Open Data strategies as an opportunity to explore what might be of interest. By making data available, stakeholders will be able to assess themselves what is useful.</li>
<li>It was also reiterated that it is more important to make datasets available than to ‘clean them up’ for publication. Stakeholders are often more concerned and interested in the raw data and being able to work with it themselves.</li>
<li>However, datasets should be shared in a format that is linkable to ensure that they can be used easily.</li>
<li>Departments are finding it challenging to examine how they can develop a dynamic market place for Open Data although they recognise that they often hold data that the Private Sector could use and would value.</li>
<li>The arrival of the Public Data Group will help to make data more readily available. The Technology Strategy Board and Research Councils have been trying to increase knowledge and understanding within business about Open Data. Professor Nigel Shadbolt has been heavily involved with looking at enabling the Private Sector to use Public Sector data and should be invited to attend a future meeting.</li>
<li>One of the facets of the Data Strategy Board will be the Open Data User Group. Members will be drawn from a range of areas of the Open Data community. This will enable government to have a two way dialogue with users, businesses and interested parties.</li>
<li>Howard Orme (BIS) invited Senior Officials to speak to colleagues in the Technology Strategy Board and Research Councils about developing the dynamic market place.</li>
<li>Linked Gov are also doing some interesting work in this area.</li>
<li>Charlotte also highlighted that where departments already have Sector Boards these appear to be working well. There is also a good level of engagement through social media and events but departments should consider further online means of engaging with the community and take a proactive approach.</li>
<li>Customer Insight is one of the weaker areas in the Open Data strategies with the primary focus being on surveys. Departments should explore ways of delivering real time feedback.</li>
<li>The Senior Officials recognised that the Open Data strategies are a vehicle for culture change across Whitehall.</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Action:</em></strong></p>
<p>-          <strong><em>Transparency Team to invite Professor Nigel Shadbolt to attend a future meeting of the Senior Officials to discuss developing a dynamic market place.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>4.  Transparency Strategy and Right to Data White Paper</strong></p>
<ul><li>Simon French provided some contextual information about the Transparency Strategy over the summer and shared the programme timeline.</li>
<li>The Transparency Team is currently working on a series of case studies which the Minister for the Cabinet Office will launch at the Open Data event on 14th March.</li>
<li>The team is looking to provide a clear evidence base for Transparency and will be looking to crowd source views into a single website for this purpose.</li>
<li>A White Paper will be published towards the end of May, after the local elections. The White Paper will cover:
<ul><li>Privacy</li>
<li>Data sharing</li>
<li>Right to Data legislation</li>
<li>A formal response to the Making Open Data Real consultation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Alongside the White Paper the team will also highlight existing departmental activity.</li>
<li>In June the Transparency Team will publish the Transparency Strategy Paper. This will include policy announcements on:
<ul><li>Midata</li>
<li>The framework for friends/family data</li>
<li>Social care reporting standards</li>
<li>Corporate responsibility.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Simon also talked through the communications strategy which covers:
<ul><li>Discussions with the USA about the Open Government Partnership</li>
<li>The Open for Business forum</li>
<li>A future Open Data Day</li>
<li>The re-launch of data.gov.uk</li>
<li>National bus and train data</li>
<li>A national Open Data appathon</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Corporate responsibility will be addressed through the Open Business Forum which will be chaired by Philip N Green. It will examine the question of how the Public Sector can engage with business to gauge how businesses are performing. Departments will hold data which will assist this. </li>
<li>Farah Ahmed talked through a slide set on the Right to Data White Paper and the amendments currently being made to the FOIA.</li>
<li>The amendments to legislation enhances the right to access data and its re-use. The revision to section 45 FOIA Code of Practice will look to the Open Government Licence. There is no change planned to the existing FOIA exemptions or charging in the amendments.</li>
<li>The third reading of the Protection of Freedoms Bill is in the House of Lords the week commencing 12th March.</li>
<li>Royal Assent is expected by the end of April.</li>
<li>The post-legislative scrutiny of the FoI Act is expected to assess the cost limit.</li>
<li>The proposal is to use the Senior Officials’ Group as a steering group for the development of the White Paper.</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Action:</em></strong></p>
<p>-          <strong><em>Transparency Team to circulate slides on the Right to Data White Paper.</em></strong></p>
<p>-          <strong><em>Transparency Team to share the actual wording of the right to data clause with Senior Officials.</em></strong></p>
<p>-          <strong><em>Senior Officials to nominate a person in their department to be a member of a working group to assist the development of the White Paper.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Benefits of Transparency</strong></p>
<ul><li> Hazel Lee reminded the Senior Officials of the six benefits of Transparency:
<ul><li>Increase accountability</li>
<li>Improve choice</li>
<li>Increase public service productivity</li>
<li>Increase public service quality</li>
<li>Encourage social growth</li>
<li>Increase economic growth</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These benefits are not only to external stakeholders but also to departments. </li>
<li>There are now 40,000 datasets available on data.gov.uk which are being used by departments, individuals and private companies. </li>
<li>NASA is now using our open source software to improve their transparency. Other countries are doing the same. They are taking our tools and building on them.</li>
<li>Transparency is highlighting duplication in departments and providing opportunities for efficiencies. </li>
<li>Senior Officials suggested that in the same way that Privacy Impact Assessments and Equality Impact Assessments are carried out, that there should be an analysis of transparency opportunities/data is conducted for new policies/projects. This would assist with embedding Transparency in departments and move away from the notion of it as an additional process.</li>
</ul><p><strong>6.  NAO Report</strong></p>
<ul><li>The NAO have found that the Transparency Team have met 23 of the 25 commitments.</li>
<li>One of the outstanding commitments is the development of departmental action plans which has been incorporated into the Open Data strategies which will be delivered in 2012.</li>
<li>The other commitment not fully met by all departments is the requirement to provide a Plain English description for each spending transaction published.</li>
<li>The Transparency Team is pushing back on some of the contextual narrative, being clear that Transparency is a Coalition initiative and distinguishing between the role of the Cabinet Office and the Transparency Team.</li>
<li>The NAO report does not sufficiently recognise that there things outside of the control of government. Government’s role should be to share data but allow others to determine what to do with it.</li>
</ul><p><strong>7. Any Other Business</strong></p>
<ul><li>The Department for Transport have received another commission from the Cabinet Office on transport data standards and asked it if was linked to the work of the Transparency Team.</li>
</ul><p>The next meeting is Thursday 26th April, 10.00 – 11.30</p>
