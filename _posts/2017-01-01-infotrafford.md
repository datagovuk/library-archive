<p><strong>InfoTrafford</strong></p>
<p><em>Trafford Council provides InfoTrafford, a free-to-access, web-based datastore with visualisation tools, to help citizens better understand the Open Data they release.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.infotrafford.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">InfoTrafford</a> is a free-to-access, web-based source of data and visualisation tools provided by Trafford Council, using <a href="/library/Geowise" rel="nofollow">geowise’s</a> instantatlas software, allowing people to find information about Trafford. This can be done either through a series of pre-set reports and area profiles, or through making their own maps, graphs, reports and profiles using tools in the website. These reports can then be shared.</p>
<p>The data covers communities, crime, the economy, education, the environment and health amongst others, and is updated regularly, allowing the change in indicators over time to be investigated, at a range of spatial levels.</p>
<p>As well as providing Trafford's communities with a tool for analysing and visualising data, InfoTrafford is being used internally, by Trafford Council and its partners, to inform service redesign, and support strategic and operational decision making.</p>
