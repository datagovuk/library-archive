<p><strong>Live Tube Maps</strong></p>
<p><em>Matthew Somerville has developed a live map drawing on Transport for London Data to show the position of trains in near real time.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Using live departure data from the Transport for London API, developer Matthew Somerville developed his real time map of all trains running on the London Underground network at the London Science Hackday in June 2010. The site went on to win second prise at the <a href="http://opendatachallenge.org/" rel="nofollow">Open Data Challenge</a>,  a European wide open data competition in mid 2011. He has also created a National Rail version.</p>
