<p>The NII is intended to ‘contain the data held by the government which is likely to have the broadest and most significant economic impact if made available and accessible outside of government’. The current NII on data.gov.uk lists 233 datasets, of which 66 are unpublished. The criteria for selecting these 233 datasets are not clear and many datasets which are fundamental to a NII are not listed. For those datasets which are identified there is no indication as to the priority for their release.<br />
	Our approach –</p>
<ul><li>We have outlined a basic structure of what we shouldknow, rather than a reflection of the data currentlyavailable. This structure covers the requirements for transparency, economic growth, social good and the underlying connector information.</li>
<li>​We have demonstrated the value of the NII for the wider public benefit as well as the needs of specific personas. </li>
<li>The next step is to identify what data is actually available as either open or closed data –particularly the core reference data.</li>
<li>We will set out proposed priorities for future open data releases of what the NII should contain and proposed sector prioritiesbased on a demand-led open data approach.</li>
<li>​Finally we will make suggestions for future improvementsto the NII. Metadata and other quality standards are important, and will be identified along with any other data publication requirements (use of core identifiers, minimum publication standards etc.).</li>
