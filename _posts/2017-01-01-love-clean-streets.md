<p><strong>Love Clean Streets</strong></p>
<p><em>The LoveCleanStreets project uses innovative technologies to improve environment services by local authorities.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.lovelewisham.org/Reports" rel="nofollow">LoveCleanStreets</a> project allows innovative technologies to improve public service delivery. Launched as Love Lewisham by Lewisham Coucil in 2005, it makes it easier for the public to report environmental crime by using camera phones and through a choice of social media gateways or via the Council itself.</p>
<p>This has lead to improved response times and efficiency savings as the Council can now see the exact size and location of the problem and respond with the right team and tools: the response time has reduced from three days to less than one day after a report is lodged, 70% of rubbish is removed within a day, and the cleanup rate has improved by 87%. Streamlining reporting has resulted in substantial efficiency savings at minimal extra cost: online reporting costs the council just £1.10 compared to £5.10 for a phone complaint, while better allocation of resources and reduced demand. Nigel Tyrel, Head of Environment at the London Borough of Lewisham, who launched the scheme said: <em>”By monitoring waste more efficiently, Lewisham Council generated an extra £20,000 of income in 2010. In 2011, our aim is to generate a further £100,000”</em>.</p>
<p>Importantly, the Love Lewisham site allows two-way interaction with the service; residents can report local environmental degradation and the Council can show whether and/or how it has responded.  This means citizens can monitor progress of the issues and in doing so, Love Lewisham helps to inspire trust and confidence, as well as make it easier to get involved in improving their local environment. The number of reports issued through the site has increased from 1,140 in 2003 to over 6,500 in 2007.</p>
<p>The result of this responsiveness is that the service has actually reduced the numbers of environmental crimes, by deterring those who commit them in the first place. The amount of Graffiti in the borough fell by 73% in the period between 2006 and 2010.</p>
<p>Love Lewisham was awarded a Green Flag for <em>“exceptional performance or innovation that others can learn from”</em> by the Audit Comission in 2009, and an Environmental Innovation Award at the Government Business Awards for the LoveLewisham initiative. In 2010, LoveCleanStreets was rolled out across London under the brand <a href="http://www.lovecleanlondon.org/" rel="nofollow">LoveCleanLondon</a>, is available to other local authorities through the Government’s G-Cloud Store, and has received interest from a number of international quarters, including Jamaica, the United States and China.</p>
