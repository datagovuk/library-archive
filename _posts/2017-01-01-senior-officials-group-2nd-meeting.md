<p><strong>3.  Transparency Programme Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Public Data Group/Data Strategy Board</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>The proposal for the Public Data Corporation (PDC) has been refined into two bodies: the Public Data Group (PDG) and the Data Strategy Board (DSB).</li>
<li>The PDG will represent the interests of the supplier side of open data whilst the DSB will act as a commissioning body.</li>
<li>The two entities will assist with ensuring the delivery of public services by departments and ensure the sustainability of the trading funds that make up the PDG.</li>
<li>The terms of reference and membership of the DSB are currently being debated. The Minister for the Cabinet Office will be a member and approximately 30% of the board will consist of Open Data activists.</li>
<li>The DSB terms of reference will now be published by the middle of February.</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Open Government Partnership</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>The main purpose of the Open Government Partnership (OGP) is to encourage countries to sign up to having freedom of information legislation.</li>
<li>The USA and Brazil are currently the co-chairs. The UK will take over from the USA in March as the junior partner. The UK will take over as lead chair in September when Brazil steps down and Indonesia joins as the junior partner.</li>
<li>Officials in the Cabinet Office, DfID and FCO are currently working on a cross-government strategy for the UK period of chair which will be put to the Minister in March. This will encompass the current UK country plan which is built around commitments made in the Prime Minister’s letters to departments. </li>
<li>There will be a large international event in Brasilia in April and the UK will host a similar event in December. The Prime Minister has been invited to attend the April event.</li>
<li>Tim Kelsey is currently in Washington for an OGP sub-committee meeting (26th – 27th January).</li>
<li>The UK will host a meeting of European countries developing country action plans on 7th February.</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Open Data Institute</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>The Chancellor’s Autumn Statement committed to providing £10million in match funding to establish the Open Data Institute (ODI). The £10million will be provided over five years.</li>
<li>The vision is for the ODI to be a world leading organisation in Open Data, providing training and development within and to broaden the Open Data community.</li>
<li>Sir Tim Berners-Lee and Professor Nigel Shadbolt will lead the ODI.</li>
<li>The business plan is currently in development. Professor Shadbolt is working with the Cabinet Office and the Technology Strategy Board (TSB) to develop it. A final version should be ready by the 6th of March and the ODI will begin operating on the 1st April. </li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Right to Data</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>The government is currently pursuing amendments to the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act in the Protection of Freedoms Bill. </li>
<li>The ‘datasets’ clause, currently before the Lords, will place a new requirement on public authorities to make datasets available for re-use, and where reasonably practicable, in a reusable format when releasing them in response to FOI requests of through publication schemes. There is currently no obligation for public authorities to provide such data in an electronic format which promotes re-use.</li>
<li>Making datasets available in this way will facilitate the organisation, interrogation and manipulation of the information so that the public can hold public authorities to account. </li>
<li>The changes will help to deliver better value for money in public spending and bring significant social and economic benefits by enabling businesses, non-profit organisations and others to exploit datasets held by public authorities for social and commercial purposes.</li>
<li>The clause received a substantial debate during the Lords Committee Stage from a cross-party contingent of Peers with an academic background.</li>
<li>There are a number of tensions currently being debated, specifically around the size and complexity of many scientific datasets and whether the operation of the FOI Act is undermining the UK’s research base.</li>
<li>The Welsh Government will be debating the proposed legislation next week (week commencing 30th January).</li>
<li>Royal Assent is expected before Easter.</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Action:</em></strong></p>
<p>-          <strong><em>Transparency Team to circulate the UK OGP action plan to Senior Officials.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>4.  Open Data Strategies</strong></p>
<ul><li>Following suggestion from the Senior Officials’ Group Information Strategies have been renamed Open Data Strategies.</li>
<li>Refreshed departmental business plans are due for publication in April and will include Open Data Strategies</li>
<li>The Open Data Strategies need to cover five types of data:
<ul><li>Big data – what general\episode data could be released and for what benefit?</li>
<li>My data – provide individuals access to personal information about themselves that is held by the department.</li>
<li>Customer satisfaction/user experience – what do citizens think about services and how can departments engage with them?</li>
<li>Creation of a dynamic information market – having an infrastructure that supports the publication and use of information.</li>
<li>Continuous improvement – Ensuring the quality of data, releasing it in the right format.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The process and timescales for submission of departments’ Open Data Strategy are designed to enable iterative discussion. </li>
<li>A one page summary of the Open Data Strategy will be published within the business plan and a full version of the Open Data Strategy will be published separately. </li>
<li>The Senior Officials’ requested that the timetable be brought in line with the timetable for the business plan. It was agreed that departments could have until 13th February to submit a substantive first draft of the Open Data Strategy to the Cabinet Office, but should work with Transparency Team colleagues in developing those drafts.</li>
<li>Although the first draft deadline has been extended it was noted that the final signed off OD Strategies would still be required by 21 March 2012.</li>
<li>The Transparency Team will hold discussions with departments to assist with the development from first draft to a final version of the Open Data Strategy.</li>
<li>The Senior Officials questioned the type of data that they would reasonably be able to propose in the ‘Satisfaction and Experience Data’ chapter. This can be addressed by looking at what new datasets might be released but also what improvements and refinements can be made to existing datasets.</li>
<li>It was agreed that the Open Data Strategies would reference other relevant strategies, e.g. digital, ICT.</li>
<li>The Senior Officials proposed sharing the draft Open Data Strategies within the group and discussing common themes at the next meeting.</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Action:</em></strong></p>
<p>-          <strong><em>Senior Officials to share draft Open Data Strategies with peers via the Transparency Team.</em></strong></p>
<p>-          <strong><em>Common themes in departmental Open Data Strategies to be discussed at the meeting on 8th March. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>5.  Feedback on Departmental Priorities</strong></p>
<ul><li> The Senior Officials discussed the topics which they had identified as being issues for discussion at forthcoming Senior Officials’ Group meetings.</li>
<li>There was a feeling that culture change across Whitehall and the business case for Transparency and Open Data were the priority issues. Anonymisation of data is also a significant issue.</li>
<li>In addition the Senior Officials felt that the accessibility and usability of data should be added to the list to facilitate a discussion on whether departments have a responsibility to make data more accessible or whether they should release it at the earliest possible time.</li>
<li>The group discussed the costs around implementing their departmental Open Data Strategies and the forthcoming NAO report on the costs and benefits of transparency. They felt it was equally important to discuss the benefits as well as the costs.</li>
<li>There was discussion of potential national security issues that could arise as a result of jigsaw mapping data from a number of different organisations.</li>
<li>The group discussed how the policy for Transparency and Open Data in central government married with the principle of localism and the extent to which Local Authority activity and actions could be determined by the centre.</li>
<li>The Senior Officials agreed to discuss the following at the next meeting:
<ul><li>Draft Open Data Strategies and emerging themes;</li>
<li>The NAO report;</li>
<li>Benefits of Transparency and Open Data.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p><strong>6.</strong>  <strong>Any Other Business</strong></p>
<ul><li>There were no items of any other business.</li>
</ul><p>The next meeting is Thursday 8th March, 10.00 – 11.30</p>
