<p>UK Location has provided this downloadable version of UK Location Metadata Editor to enable system managers to quickly develop their own metadata tools. The editor can be either deployed as is or developed as a full publishing environment. The editor is fully open source.</p>
<p><strong>!! WARNING !! This software is now DEPRECATED so will not be updated as the metadata standards required by UK Location &amp; data.gov.uk update later in 2014. In late Spring 2014, UK Location will provide a new metadata editor, but as an on-line service ONLY. The download on this page only remains for historical interest. 7/2/14</strong></p>
<p>To deploy the editor you will need to download and install GeoNetwork, then apply UK Location configuration files to the product.</p>
<p>A detailed installation guide is provided in the configuration download.</p>
<p><em>The UK Location Metadata Editor has been developed by Ordnance Survey with the UK Location Programme.</em></p>
