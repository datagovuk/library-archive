<p>This guidance document sets out in detail how to create, publish and maintain discovery metadata for data sets published into the UK Location Infrastructure.  It covers all location information including INSPIRE data sets.</p>
<p>The guide is revised in the light of operational experience and feedback. You are encouraged to add a comment to share your experiences with the UK Location Programme Team.</p>
<p>Please note that whilst the Devolved Administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are part of UK Location, they may have different publishing mechanisms to those described.</p>
