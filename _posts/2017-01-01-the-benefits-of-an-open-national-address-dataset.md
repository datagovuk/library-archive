<p>The analysis provided here considers some basic factors around the current producers and users of national addressing data, without attempting to quantify in detail the wider social benefits arising from improved transparency and efficiency in public service delivery, the benefit citizens will derive from these improved services and the potential for business growth and increased employment were this data to be made open. Although many of our benefit estimates are approximate when combined we believe that the benefits calculated could easily exceed Â£1bn per annum.</p>
