<p><strong>trains.im</strong></p>
<p><em>Trains.im draws on the National Rail Timetable to provide an improved journey planner for UK national rail.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://trains.im/" rel="nofollow">Trains.im</a> uses data comes from the National Rail Timetable, a weekly dataset released since November 2011 at data.atoc.org. Â It includes intermediate timing point data, and information on platforms. Additionally, it uniquely identifies every station and timing point on the network. Geographical information comes from <a href="/library/Open-Street-Map-Foundation" rel="nofollow">OpenStreetMap</a> (a freely licensed map) - which itself incorporates NaPTAN data from the Department for Transport under agreement.</p>
<p>The site has been developed by an individual, Ian Shortman, to make the data accessible to the public. Information includes: availability of timetables (with platform information, intermediate timings, information on facilities) and a visual plot of train journeys on a map, which can be clicked at intermediate stations to see the timings. This provides information on where a train is headed and what route it's taking to get there.</p>
