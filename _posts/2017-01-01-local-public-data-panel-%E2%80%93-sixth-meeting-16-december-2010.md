<p><strong>Other Attendees:</strong><strong> </strong>Baroness Hanham (items 2-4), Councillor Liam Maxwell (Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead Borough Council), Emer Coleman (London Assembly), Kieron O’Hara (University of Southampton).  </p>
<p><strong>Secretariat:</strong><strong> </strong>Philip Worsfold and Padma Juggapah.</p>
<p><strong>Item 1: Minutes / Matters Arising / Actions</strong></p>
<p>Minutes of the 22 October meeting were agreed. The Panel’s response to the Department of Health “Information Revolution” consultation would be circulated shortly. <strong>Action:</strong> <strong>Janet Hughes</strong></p>
<ul><li>The NHS in London had showed the Health Sector was open to quickly releasing data.</li>
</ul><p>Consultation on the Government’s Single Data list for local authorities “Reducing Local Data Reporting” was scheduled to launch on 17 December. (<a href="http://www.communities.idea.gov.uk/c/1729072/home.do" rel="nofollow">http://www.communities.idea.gov.uk/c/1729072/home.do</a>.)</p>
<p>Ensuring data was published by private companies providing public services remained a concern. Knowing which Ministers were leading the issue would help ensure it remained high on the agenda but it was important the Panel championed a solution.</p>
<ul><li>The issue stemmed from current Freedom of Information provisions, where there was a lack of clarity on the operation of joint ventures.</li>
<li>Intellectual property and the structure of contracts provided a second problem. On this,it was important to champion the public data principles – indeed the panel felt procurement of services involving a public data element should stipulate that the data remained available and open consistent with any security or personal privacy considerations. There was also a problem of contrary legal opinion. Again, in this situation Freedom of Information should trump all other considerations.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Action: Pursue and develop a position statement on this (DCLG / Panel members)</strong>.</p>
<p>There had been no change of advice on the routine publication of VAT numbers when disclosing expenditure data. Advice remained not to publish at this stage.</p>
<ul><li>VAT numbers were already widely available online; preventing the disclosure of information therefore did little to prevent fraud.</li>
<li>The concern was whether publication increased a cumulative risk of fraud. There was merit in getting a better understanding of this risk and how systems could mitigate it before going further. HMRC was conducting such an assessment, which would be concluded before the New Year.</li>
</ul><p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Action: DCLG </strong></p>
<p>The Local Government Group had updated guidance for councils following a consultation. A summary of responses and changes to the initial document had also been produced.</p>
<ul><li>There needed to be increased visibility of the Panel’s guide currently on data.gov.uk and to ensure the LG Group guide was cross referenced. The Panel guide provided some more detailed advice on publication of spend data.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Action: DCLG / Local Government Group.</strong></p>
<ul><li>The Panel’s blog on expenditure guidance remained open for and should be updated as required.</li>
<li>It was likely the overwhelming majority of councils would respond to the request to publish £500 expenditure and heed the advice.</li>
<li>There needed to be more effort to institutionalise transparency and ensure non-compliant councils were pursued.</li>
<li>Data transparency should be accounted for in new audit arrangements following abolition of the Audit Commission. There also needed to be a strategy for taking forward data transparency through senior Champions in local government.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Item 2: Crime Data</strong></p>
<p>Liam Maxwell updated on work to publish street level crime data. The data release had been discussed with the Association of Chief Police Officers, Information Commissioner’s Office and National Policing Improvement Agency. The ICO had also published advice (2 December) on the release. It had been proposed that the data be released with a 12 property threshold.</p>
<p>Liam Maxwell and Nigel Shadbolt provided advice for publishing the data to the Home Office – some of which had been adopted for example the production of data files, the adoption of the Open Government Licence. However, the issue of spatial and temporal detail remained a problem, as did the lateness of specific information about the date and time of the report and use of URNs.</p>
<p>It remained likely the proposals would see only 53 day old data being published. There was therefore much more to do to improve the frequency of this data. Three vanguard areas were being proposed to take the initiative further: Hampshire, Thames Valley (with Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead) and West Yorkshire.</p>
<ul><li>It was clear certain types crime data, for example on domestic violence or other inter-family crime, should be blurred to protect privacy. But it was equally important not to miss an opportunity by limiting the scope of data released. Pinpoint mapping of anti-social behaviour incidents had, for example, helped communities and agencies to better manage the public realm damaged by unscrupulous licensed premises.</li>
<li>Hampshire Police’s proposed system was best practice in action and they should be applauded for it.</li>
<li>There had been movement from original proposals with the prospect of more open data as a result but the vanguard areas needed backing to provide cover for other police forces that wanted to do more with the data they held.</li>
<li>Additional work was also needed to get data published that was contained in the existing Home Office hub.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Item 3: </strong><strong>Privacy review</strong></p>
<p>Kieron O’Hara outlined plans for the Transparency and Privacy review, which had been launched by Francis Maude on 7 December. This work would examine the relationship and risks associated with transparency and privacy to shape the future release of Government data. The Cabinet Office had commissioned a report, including practical steps to manage any risk, by March 2011. At this stage it was clear transparency should benefit community accountability of the state but the review would strengthen the empirical base so that there was less reliance on placing seemingly arbitrary limits to what data was released.</p>
<ul><li>It was essential the review accounted for the needs of citizens as a whole. The real benefits from transparency could only be realised where different communities and interests, with better information, felt ownership of the data. Community engagement was essential.</li>
<li>Comparisons should be made between the current UK plans to release crime data with those in the US, where there is extensive, high precision data mapping. There had been negligible damage to individual citizens but widespread positive social impacts. In one example there had been around 2 million hits and only 6 complaints – which had been about inaccuracies than concerns about data protection privacy</li>
<li>The major issue to be addressed was increasing understanding of data, particularly in central government. The release of crime number information, for example, was critical for accountability but this was not understood by the holders of the data.</li>
<li>The interaction between public data and wider systems was also at play – for example much of the crime data underpinned decisions and systems in the insurance industry</li>
<li>An ideal benchmark for data protection should be that where an individual was protected in court proceedings there should also be “protected in data”. There should also be a presumption that those seeking data would be able to manage data privacy.</li>
<li>The review provided an excellent opportunity for general benefits of transparency and data to be written up.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Item 4: </strong><strong>Cabinet Office update</strong></p>
<p>Cass Chideock updated on restructuring within the Cabinet Office team following Andrew Stott’s retirement. Focus was now shifting to the privacy review (as above), implementing commitments made by the Prime Minister in May 2010 and the future. Future plans included identifying:</p>
<p>- Priority data sets for release;</p>
<p>- Establishing new standards to ensure Whitehall identified data sets and championed its release;</p>
<p>- reviewing the user experience of data.gov.uk;</p>
<p>- working to establish the public data corporation, with BIS and HMT; and</p>
<p>- legislating to confirm the ‘right to data’.</p>
<ul><li>It was clear that greater prominence of the work was needed. The public data principles were a powerful statement of how to proceed but they needed to be made much more prominent in peoples’ thinking.</li>
<li>The data transparency agenda was compelling but it needed to be sold in all communications with Departments and to ensure there was a strong push from the top of organisations. At present a number of Departments appeared to be doing the minimum: board level ownership was needed across departments and agencies.</li>
<li>Work was needed to audit existing data sets as there was no systematic inventory of data or asset register for Departments. The Department for Transport’s Asset Register was very comprehensive, based on FOI requests and due to publish in January 2011.</li>
<li>There were enormous technical challenges in both awareness and capability across Whitehall that remained.</li>
<li>Having made big statements on the potential of data transparency, the Government and public sector needed to ensure totemic data sets were released in order to remain credible.</li>
<li>Cross-government action was needed to ensure transparency issues became a standard consideration in policy development. Government Departments were not yet “thinking transparency”. The Transparency Board needed to be more integrated and active in this regard.</li>
<li>Data transparency was a compelling agenda but public bodies needed to engage or risk being bypassed by the large scale mobilisation of people and ideas that technology had facilitated in others areas of life. Some public bodies were catching up but massive culture change remained a priority issue. <strong> </strong></li>
</ul><p><strong>Item 5: </strong><strong>Total Transparency</strong></p>
<p>Roger Hampson reflected on how data transparency was affecting the London Borough of Redbridge. There had been fundamental change to the public sector context. The technology to hold huge amounts of data now existed, the speed of transactions had massively increased and social impacts were profound: large numbers of people were now in constant contact with each other. These new dynamics changed the relationship between citizen and the state but most public authorities had yet to recognise that. Redbridge was adapting to transform the relationship people had with the council and to change the authority itself – in how it did business and the richness of its relationship with residents. For example, the council had trialled the use of mass collaborations with 5000 residents including how to deal with financial pressures using the “youchoose” device and the its website could now be personalised so that services were better targeted at specific areas or communities. The council had also taken the view that, while all private or secure data would remain so, every other data set the council had would be opened and available from February 2011.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>The Panel considered how to achieve similar standards across public bodies.</p>
<ul><li>Massive organisational change was required for such an approach to be replicated across the local and central state.</li>
<li>Risk averse attitudes needed to be challenged and it was also necessary to challenge the idea that public sector not able to ‘fail’ – learning from personal failures were accepted as the basis for improvement and innovation; it was foolish for state to be deemed different in this regard.</li>
<li>Transparency helped incumbent politicians and officers more than they currently realised. Far from being a threat, it provided them with a good opportunity to provide insight into what was being done.</li>
<li>Organisations needed to adapt to a new public management model. This was centred not on targets and performance measures but a revised relationship between individuals and the state. This relationship needed to be based on an openness of knowledge and understanding. Too often there was not enough socialisation of how public bodies sought to change.</li>
<li>The importance of data was not explicit in the public sector change process. It remained necessary to push and argue for data to be released. A greater push on communications and data literacy was needed. Open data case studies were in the pipeline and could be supported by a wide range of web resources.</li>
<li>Technological change meant every individual had the potential to publish their views. The essential task was therefore to remove barriers to this activity and opening up information to citizens was the basic requirement. If bureaucracies failed to adapt they would simply be bypassed and lose further relevance to people’s lives.</li>
<li>Each decision made by public bodies currently required human rights or value for money considerations; a similar test for transparency was needed.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Action: Hulya Mustafa / Will Perrin to progress open data case studies</strong></p>
<p><strong>Any Other Business </strong></p>
<p>The Panel could not endorse the proposal for a competition presented to them. The prizes on offer would not generate sufficient new local data activities, particularly from the developer community. There were other campaigns identifying and developing good use of data currently being published and similar activity would not add value</p>
<p>There was some discussions on the potential for a small project fund but given the financial constraints the Department was under, this was unlikely to be put in place. Other activities, such as “developers in residence” were suggested as better initiatives to support use of local data.</p>
<p><strong>Action</strong>: <strong>Emer Coleman to advise DCLG on possible activities.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Roger Hampson and Janet Hughes had met with Google Public Sector.</p>
<p>It was requested that the next meeting major on use of data, community building and the Big Society</p>
