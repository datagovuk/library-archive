<p><strong>I heart my city</strong></p>
<p><em>Hyper-local mapping of council spending data and quality of life metrics can help people understand how council spending is helping make their lives better.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.watershed.co.uk/dshed/content/introducing-i-heart-my-city" rel="nofollow">I  Heart My City</a> is an online map created from open source data which shows how Bristol city council distribute funds, and the impact this has on quality of life. The project aimed to reveal the good work conducted by the council in a personal, localised way.</p>
<p><a href="/library/Delib" rel="nofollow">Delib</a> were commissioned by Media Sandbox to create an online map to show the correlation between council spending and quality of life metrics as part of a campaign for using local data in <a href="/library/Bristol-B-Open-Datastore" rel="nofollow">Bristol</a></p>
<p>The map drew on a selected set of happiness performance indicators and council spend across the Local Enterprise Partnership to visualise to the public how council spending has a positive impact on a hyper local level, and transform the public’s relation to spending data through use of positive language, friendly design and simple, social interaction.</p>
