<p><strong>FIND</strong></p>
<p><em>FIND offers a means to find free maps and data layers; and also provides an easy to use toolkit for making and printing customised maps.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.findfreemaps.co.uk" rel="nofollow">FIND</a> want to make mapping more accessible and encourage wider use of maps and geographic information.  Their site offers free and unlimited access to a range of maps, data layers and an easy-to-use toolkit for making and printing customised maps.  Users can choose appropriate background and scale, add data layers, draw on maps and insert text and symbols, some of the functionality you only expect to see in high-end geographical information systems. They can be used to instantly measure distance and areas.</p>
<p>The service draws on <a href="/library/Ordnance-Survey-Open-Data" rel="nofollow">Ordnance Survey OpenData</a>, with contours and administrative boundaries among the most frequently-used features, as well as information released by other sources such as Natural England, British Geological Survey and RSPB.</p>
<p>The site’s users range from outdoor enthusiasts to charity event organisers and people submitting local planning applications.</p>
