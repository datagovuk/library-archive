<p><strong>UpNorthAuditor</strong></p>
<p><em>Inspired by Armchair Audtitor and based on the same source code, UpNorthAuditor allows users to understand and analyse Open Data on spending by several Councils in the North of England.</em></p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="/library/Armchair-Auditor" rel="nofollow">Windsor and Maidenhead Armchair Auditor</a>, UpNorthAuditor provides the same service, but drawing on <a href="/library/Hull-City-Council-Open-Data" rel="nofollow">Hull County Council’s</a> and North Lincolnshire’s spending data. The site is working to include North East Lincolshire, York City Council and East Riding Council data.</p>
<p>UpNorthAuditor has been instrumental in showing the value that Open Data can provide to Councils by demonstrating that open data to the public can open it to better use within the organisation holding the data, facilitating better use of the data and allowing open source solutions to be applied at lower cost that some legacy systems.</p>
