<p><strong>London Datastore</strong></p>
<p><em>The London Datastore provides access to data that the GLA and other public sector organizations hold.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://data.london.gov.uk/" rel="nofollow">The London Datastore</a> was created by the Greater London Authority (GLA) as a first step towards freeing London’s data, providing access to data that the GLA and other public sector organizations hold.  Available for free use and reuse, however people see fit, the London Datastore has joined up with <a href="http://channel4.com/programmes/4ip" rel="nofollow">4iP</a> to create a development fund to encourage developers to use the raw data to develop apps, websites and mobile products.</p>
<p>There is a steady increase demand for the data.  Visits to the site have risen to number over 625,000 page views between February 2011 and March 2012 and over 177,000 unique visitors.  During that period, the site has received representing almost three per cent of London’s adult population.  The London Datastore user database currently includes local government staff, GLA staff, private sector workers, voluntary/charity organisation, academics, central government staff, and interested members of the public.</p>
<p>The supply of data is driven by commitment of the GLA to put out as much of its own data as possible and by using its influence to persuade other public sector organizations into releasing their data via the Datastore.</p>
<p>Analysis by the London Datastore shows that the most popular datasets are those that have some kind of product or visualisation to make them more accessible.  In particular, Transport for London data released by the Datastore underpins several important applications, such as <a href="/library/Live-Tube-Maps" rel="nofollow">live tube maps</a>, <a href="/library/Busit" rel="nofollow">bus journey planners</a> and  maps of <a href="/library/Popular-bicycle-routes-in-London" rel="nofollow">popular bicycle routes</a>, as well as information on <a href="/library/Londons-cycle-accident-blackspots" rel="nofollow">accident black-spots</a> and location of available <a href="/library/Barclays-Cycle-Hire-Scheme" rel="nofollow">Barclays Cycle Hire</a> bikes.</p>
