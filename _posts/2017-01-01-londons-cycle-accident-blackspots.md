<p> <strong>London’s cycle accident blackspots</strong></p>
<p><em>Using data provided by Transport for London, the Telegraph set out to map the cycle accident blackspots in London.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="/library/London-DataStore" rel="nofollow">Transport for London</a> released the details on every cycle accident reported to them between August 2010 and July 2011. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/road-safety/8989366/Graphic-Londons-cycle-accident-black-spots-mapped.html" rel="nofollow">The Telegraph</a> mapped this data to identify blackspots: the most dangerous areas for cycling in London. Junctions north and south of Blackfriar’s Bridge were notable for the site of several serious accidents in the time period covered.</p>
