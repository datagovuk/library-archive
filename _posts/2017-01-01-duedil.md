<p><a href="http://www.duedil.com" rel="nofollow">Duedil</a> is a business information provider based in Soho, London. Duedil gives free access to governance and financial information for every company in the UK and Ireland, and combines this with data from online sources, APIs, social networks, and more. Duedil was launched in April 2011, by entrepreneur Damian Kimmelman. Since April the team has grown from six employees to fourteen.</p>
<p>Its aim is to make business more transparent, by opening up company information to make the due diligence and research process simple and intuitive. By aggregating and linking all the available information, users can gain a comprehensive understanding of businesses and the people who run them.</p>
<p>Duedil founder, Damian Kimmelman, says:<em>“Open data from the Government is crucial to our operation – from our core data set, Companies House, to additional information we can match to companies from the London Gazette, the FSA, the SFO, the OFT, the Intellectual Property Office, the Office of Government Commerce, and Ordnance Survey data. The more data we can find on companies, the more comprehensive a profile we can build, and the more useful that is to the end user”.</em></p>
<p>Because of the access it has to different data sources, one of the most important tasks Duedil has is to present information in a way that enables users to gain greater insight into the business world without getting lost in all the data – help them ‘see the word for the trees’.</p>
<p>The information currently available on the site will always remain free. However, in the near future, it will offer a platform to sell premium data – whether privately bought or proprietary. In one year it aims to double the size of the team again, and it aims to become the number one source of company information in the UK.</p>
