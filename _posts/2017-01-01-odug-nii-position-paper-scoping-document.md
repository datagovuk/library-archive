<p>In October 2013 the Government published the first iteration of the National Information Infrastructure (NII) intended to ‘contain the data held by the government which is likely to have the broadest and most significant economic impact if made available and accessible outside of government’.</p>
<p>ODUG’s view, shared by many in the data community, is that the Government should clearly articulate what constitutes underlying core reference data within the NII, together with a structured release schedule, to maximise the medium term impact of new open data. To assist with an improved definition of the NII and help identify suitable priorities for data release ODUG is developing a position paper on how the NII should be structured.</p>
<p>This document sets the scope/terms of reference of the position paper.</p>
