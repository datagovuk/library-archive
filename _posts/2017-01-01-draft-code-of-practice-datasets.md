<p>This Code of Practice (datasets) fulfils the duty of the Secretary of State for Justice set out in section 45 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 ("the Act”) in relation to datasets.2. Section 102 of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 amended section 11 (Means by which communication to be made) and section 19 (Publication schemes) of the Act and inserted new sections 11A and 11B. The practical effect of the amendments is to require a public authority releasing a dataset under that Act to do so in a way that enables the dataset to be used and re-used.</p>
<p>This means that the public authority must, firstly, provide the dataset in a re-usable format, where reasonably practicable; and, secondly, grant a licence (in accordance with one of the specified licences in this Code) under which the dataset can be re-used.</p>
<p>This draft publication is in <a title="consultation" href="/consultation" target="_self" rel="nofollow">consultation</a> until 10 January 2013.</p>
