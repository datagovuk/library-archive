<p><strong>Who Owns My Neighbourhood?</strong></p>
<p><em>Who Owns My Neighbourhood? is a website that uses council and crowd-sourced data to help you find who owns the plots of land in your neighbourhood.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://whoownsmyneighbourhood.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">Who Owns My Neighbourhood?</a> was developed by Thumbprint Co-operative in partnership with Kirklees Council, as part of NESTAâ€™s <a href="http://www.nesta.org.uk/areas_of_work/public_services_lab/make_it_local" rel="nofollow">Make it Local</a> programme. The service opens up data on the ownership of land held by Kirklees Council, so that local citizens can see who owns the places where they live. The aim is to encourage people to think about who is responsible for our local environment.</p>
<p>Residents who have an active interest in particular places can find and share information, make contact with others who are interested in the same spaces, and co-ordinate activities to improve the area. For example, people who wish to clear overgrown, disused plots of dangerous objects can determine who to contact to obtain permission, find others who might help and suggest other possibilities for the land or building, such as developing a playground or preventing buildings from becoming more derelict.</p>
