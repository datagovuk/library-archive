<p><strong>BUSit</strong></p>

<p><em>BUSit uses Transport for London data to provide a mobile ready journey planner for multi-leg bus journeys.</em></p>
<p>Using data from <a href="http://www.data.gov.uk/library/London-DataStore" rel="nofollow">Transport for London</a>,Â <a href="http://www.busitlondon.co.uk/" rel="nofollow"> BUSit</a> is a mobile ready journey planner that plans multi-leg bus journeys. Simply let the web app detect you current location and then click on the map to indicate your destination. BUSit will then plan your route for you indicating which buses to catch, where to catch them and where to change.</p>
<p>Designed to work when you are on the move on your smart phone, or at home planning a journey, BUSit uses custom routing algorithms to provide up to 5 different routes to get you to your destination with the routes displayed on a <a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Google Map</a> with an optional <a href="http://www.data.gov.uk/library/open-street-map-foundation" rel="nofollow">OpenStreetMap</a> layer.</p>
