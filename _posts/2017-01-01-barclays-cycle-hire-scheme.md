<p><strong>Barclays Cycle Hire Scheme</strong></p>
<p><em>Oli O’Brien has built a website that uses Transport for London data to map nearby available hire bikes and docking stations in London, helping users of the scheme find a bike and a place to leave it.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mayor of London Boris Johnson launched the Barclays Cycle Hire Scheme across central London in July 2010. Even the Mayor conceded that cyclists could face a shortage of bikes and problems returning them to the 'docking stations' throughout the city; getting the distribution and redistribution of bikes across the city was always going to be the biggest challenge for the scheme. </p>
<p>Independent developer Oli O’Brien – an MSc student at the <a href="http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/casa" rel="nofollow">Centre for Spatial Analysis</a>, University College London – has developed a <a title="Mapping Tool" href="http://bikes.oobrien.com/london/" rel="nofollow">mapping tool</a> which collates and visualises data on the location of the ‘Boris Bikes’ in real time, revealing where the hot spots are and free docking stations. Oli and his colleagues are now rolling out this map to bike schemes across the world. Users can download this real time information online or via mobile apps, easing their journey across busy, congested cities.</p>
