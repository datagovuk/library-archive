<p><strong>PAERS Ltd</strong></p>
<p><em>PAERS Ltd. is a small independent company set up by doctors to help patients securely access their own medical records online</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.paers.net" rel="nofollow">PAERS</a> Ltd is a small independent company set up by doctors to provide tools for GP surgeries to enhance services for their patients.  Established in 2003, PAERS has produced a platform to allow all EMIS practices (55% of UK) to register patients at the reception for free, giving them secure online access to their GP electronic records from anywhere in the world through a web browser. The data is automatically linked to good quality information so that patients can understand what they read. In addition, the record is reformatted so that it is easy for patients to find what they need.</p>
<p>Patients are also able to access other transactional services, such as online appointment bookings, repeat medication and secure messaging between the patient and the practice.</p>
<p>This allows patients to manage their own care and use NHS services more efficiently and effectively.  There is accumulating evidence that it saves practices appointments and telephone calls. It can also help with continuity of care by enabling patients to share their records securely with other professional care providers or family members.  This can support access to information where visual impairment or digital literacy might be an issue.</p>
