<p>﻿<strong>Europe’s CO2 Emissions</strong></p>
<p><em>Sandbag’s maps use Open Data from the European Emissions Trading Scheme to show the performance of Europe’s carbon market.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sandbag is a London based Community Interest Community dedicated to improving the transparency and environmental performance of the European carbon market.</p>
<p>The EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) is currently the world’s largest climate policy, directly policing two billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions annually. Sandbag maps the emissions of the power stations and factories within the scheme against the free pollution allowances awarded them by governments. These maps show where European emissions are most concentrated and highlight the companies and factories where spare carbon allowances are accumulating.</p>
<p>Sandbag campaigns to reduce the number of carbon allowances in circulation so that less pollution is allowed to take place.</p>
<p>Sandbag’s <a href="http://www.sandbag.org.uk" rel="nofollow">maps</a> use open data from the European Commission’s Community Installation Transaction Log, the United Nations offset registry, Google maps and proprietary research data to present their online map and search tools.</p>
