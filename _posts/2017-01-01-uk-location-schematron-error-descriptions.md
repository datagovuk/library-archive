<p>This document translates every constraint in the GEMINI Schematron schema into non-technical language. The intention is to make it easier for Data Providers and other users of the Schematron to understand and interpret the error messages and the actions that are needed in response to those error messages. The intention is that in providing clearer explanations of the constraints enforced and their associated error messages, users will be assisted in creating valid UK GEMINI2 metadata.</p>
