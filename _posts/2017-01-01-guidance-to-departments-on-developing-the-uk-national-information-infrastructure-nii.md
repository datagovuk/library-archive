<p>In response to recommendations in the Shakespeare Review of Public Sector Information, the government set out a three pronged approach to releasing further open data:</p>
<p>To support this work it committed to “set out the data we already have by department and invite comment from business users about what data they would like released”.</p>
<p>This commitment to developing an inventory of the data held by Government reflects existing policy and builds on good practice in fulfilling the regulations on Public Sector Information. For instance in terms of the Transparency agenda:</p>
<ul><li>a partial inventory of the data that central government departments, as well as many Arms Length Bodies and Local Authorities, hold is currently already available on Data.gov.uk</li>
<li>the Open Data White Paper committed government (public bodies) to identifying and publishing priority datasets and over time removing barriers to the publication of more datasets.</li>
<li>through Open Data Strategies, Departments have set out a clear timeline for publication for a subset of the data they hold and a route for users to request further data to be made open.</li>
</ul><p>Data publishers can take part in this inventory up till the end of August 2013 by:</p>
<ul><li>logging into data.gov.uk with your publisher login</li>
<li>click the manage inventory button to get started</li>
</ul>
