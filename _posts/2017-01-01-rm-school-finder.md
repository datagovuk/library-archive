<p><strong>RM School Finder</strong></p>
<p><em>RM School Finder is a website that uses Open Data to help parents find the right local school for their children.</em></p>
<p>RM Education is a UK based company that provides educational resources and ICT for schools and parents. In June 2012 they launched a website, <a href="//home.rm.com/schoolfinder/" rel="nofollow">RM School Finder</a> to help parents choose a school for their child.</p>
<p>The website is designed to be easy to use, allowing parents to chose their location, select a group of schools and compare them. </p>
<p>RM School Finder aims to present the information that will be most useful to parents to help them choose a school, helping them answer the common questions parents have when choosing a school, such as what pupils achieve, what inspectors say, and whether they will be able to get a place at the school. </p>
<p>To answer these questions, RM School Finder uses school data published by the Department for Education and Ofsted including School Performance Tables, GCSE Subject Results and Ofsted inspection outcomes. Schools also have the opportunity to provide some additional information about the school, such as how parents will be involved, extracurricular activities and how the school describes itself.</p>
