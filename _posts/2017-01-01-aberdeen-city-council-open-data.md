<p><em>Aberdeen City Council provides access to its data in linked data format making it easier for citizens to hold it to account and build useful applications.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/open_data/open_data_home.asp" rel="nofollow">Aberdeen City Council</a> provides the public with access to its data so they ca hold it to account and build useful applications.</p>
<p>To make it as easy as possible for developers and website owners to access and present data held by us in ways they want, the Council hosts a selection of its open data in Linked Data format.  It is also allows users to browse through the data on the web, to query the data using SPARQL, and to interconnect it with other Linked Data resources.  For example, data can be viewed using <a title="Yahoo Pipes" href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/" rel="nofollow">Yahoo Pipes</a>, a free mashup tool, helping to make sure that people who live or work in, or visit, Aberdeen can get involved.</p>
<p>A local Aberdeen web Developer has just released a <a href="http://furrybootsapp.com/" rel="nofollow">web-based mobile app</a> which is built, in part, on city-wide Events Data which Aberdeen City Council provides as Open Data.</p>
<p>While their datastore is still under development, the Council plans to add steadily more datasets and additional ways of accessing and viewing the data, and is actively looking at the creation of an Open Data portal approach such as those provided by Enschede or <a href="http://www.dublinked.ie/" rel="nofollow">Dublin</a>.</p>
