<p><strong>Mapnificent</strong></p>
<p><em>Mapnificient uses transport and mapping data to show what areas of a city can be reached in a given period of time.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.mapnificent.net/" rel="nofollow">Mapnificient</a> is a mapping application which draws on open data provided by local authority transport providers to show the travel times overlaid onto a map, giving a visualisation of the areas in a city that can be reached in a given period of time using public transport systems.</p>
<p>Similar to MySociety’s <a href="http://mapumental.com/" rel="nofollow">Mapumental</a>, Mapnificent provides an interactive visualisation of public transport for over 50 cities worldwide. In the UK it draws on data provided by <a href="http://www.data.gov.uk/library/London-DataStore" rel="nofollow">Transport for London</a> and <a href="http://www.data.gov.uk/library/DataGM-Greater-Manchester-Data-Store" rel="nofollow">Transport for Greater Manchester</a> to provide travel time maps for London and Manchester.</p>
