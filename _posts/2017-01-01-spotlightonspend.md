<p>By providing a managed service, spotlightonspend cuts costs by removing the need to add to headcount, eliminates the complexity of becoming and staying compliant with policy, and reduces the risk of inadvertent breach of the Data Protection Legislation. It also enhances the information Local Authorities publish to improve its accessibility, relevance and value for the intended audience – the general public.</p>
<p>The spotlightonspend service includes the cleansing, classification, enrichment and redaction of raw transactional data derived from the authority’s accounts payable system. Updated either monthly, quarterly or annually, the service also includes an intuitive, easy-to-use web application that is quickly and easily deployed and is accessed by the general public directly from the local authority’s own website. The service also includes management of the process of publishing downloadable, policy compliant files to data.gov.uk.</p>
