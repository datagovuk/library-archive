<p><strong>Windsor and Maidenhead DataTap</strong></p>
<p><em>The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead (RBWM) DataTap is a cloud based, central, unified platform for all RBWM’s open data and transparency needs.</em></p>
<p>Built by <a href="http://www.arcusglobal.com/blog/" rel="nofollow">Arcus Global</a>, a UK company set up to introduce Cloud Computing to the UK public sector, the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead (RBWM) <a href="http://rbwm.arcusglobal.com/DataTAP/" rel="nofollow">DataTap</a> is a cloud based, central, unified platform for all open data and transparency needs.</p>
<p>Winner of the Media Guardian Innovation Award for best use of data, DataTap is used by Windsor and Maidenhead to publish full information on councillor allowances at ward level, all council expenditure and third party expenditure above £500, resident service requests from the CRM system (different types of requests, separated by wards), local crime data syndicated from Thames Valley Police, local population statistics (from council systems) and lists and locations of polling stations, schools, and libraries in the Borough.</p>
<p>DataTAP publishes data automatically both as user friendly web pages and in machine readable formats, using tables, charts, maps or complex dashboards without the need for any customisation.  It allows data from any internal system to be published in full compliance with current and future transparency requirements, and provides tools to combine, compare and <em>“mash”</em> data from internal and external sources.</p>
<p>The site uses <a href="/library/Ordnance-Survey-Open-Data" rel="nofollow">OS OpenData</a>  to instantly visualise a range of council information including population, councillor’s allowances and crime statistics, helping make the data more accessible – and more meaningful – than if it were presented in tables or spreadsheets, or scattered across multiple council web pages.</p>
