<p> C<strong>ycleStreets</strong><em>CycleStreets is a UK-wide cycle journey planner system, letting cyclists plan routes from A to B by bike.</em>
</p><p><a href="http://www.cyclestreets.net/" rel="nofollow">CycleStreets</a> is a UK-wide cycle journey planner system, which lets you plan routes from A to B by bike. It is designed by cyclists, for cyclists, and caters for the needs of both confident and less confident cyclists.</p>
<p>CycleStreets is a national version of the Journey Planner and Photomap launched by Cambridge Cycling Campaign in June 2006.  Since then following a presentation of the Cambridge-only system at the CCN/CTC Conference in November 2006 in Cheltenham, the company has received many enquiries from people and organisations around the UK about the possibility of having a version for 'their' area.  Since then they have worked to produce a national system.</p>
