<p> <strong>1.  Introduction</strong></p>
<ul><li>Tim Kelsey welcomed all attendees to the first meeting of and explained the rationale behind the establishment of the Senior Officials’ Group:
<ul><li>Ensure clarity on the Transparency agenda</li>
<li>Maintain and develop strategic relationships with departments to ensure the appropriate level of support and customer service</li>
<li>Collaborative approach to Transparency</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p> <strong>2.  <em>Making Open Government Real</em> White Paper</strong></p>
<ul><li>Sophia Oliver gave an overview of the direction of travel of the White Paper. </li>
<li>It would be used as the basis for working with departments and the Senior Officials’ Group will be asked to advise and discuss how best to use Transparency across government. </li>
<li>Intention was to present to the January Senior Officials’ Group meeting on the content.</li>
<li>Six key workstreams had been identified which would be explored in the context of ‘Open Data’, ‘Open Government’ and ‘Open Britain’:
<ul><li>Benefits</li>
<li>Right to Data</li>
<li>Knowledge economy within Public Services</li>
<li>Open Government capabilities</li>
<li>Customer Insight</li>
<li>Transparency in practice</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These would shape the future agenda of the Transparency programme.</li>
<li>There was discussion about ensuring the White Paper linked cohesively with other ERG agendas, e.g. Digital, ICT Futures. The Senior Officials’ Group would be invited to comment and provide input on specific areas of the White Paper to ensure that it took account of the needs of each department, including the devolved assemblies. </li>
<li>There would be some further work on benefits and their measures.</li>
</ul><p><strong>3.  Terms of Reference</strong></p>
<ul><li>The draft Terms of Reference were agreed.</li>
<li>The attendees welcomed the initiative and felt it would provide a good vehicle for sharing information and experiences.</li>
<li>Attendees proposed that external speakers be invited to present to the group.</li>
<li>There were a number of topics that members of the group felt should be addressed at future meetings, e.g. publication of Gateway reports. The Transparency Team committed to having conversations with each Senior Official on the topics they would like on a future agenda.</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Action:</em></strong></p>
<p>-          <strong><em>Transparency Team to contact all members of the Senior Officials’ Group to discuss what topics should be covered at future meetings.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>4.  Information Strategies</strong></p>
<ul><li>Pete Lawrence outlined the plans for the departmental Information Strategies and timetable for publication. These Strategies would set out departmental approaches to determining and prioritising dataset release and publication as well as providing a forward look schedule of publication of datasets between April 2012 and March 2014. </li>
<li>A first draft Information Strategy would need to be provided by each department by the end of January 2012 with final ‘signed off’ versions required by the end of March 2012.</li>
<li>The Information Strategies would cover five types of data:
<ul><li>Big data – what general\episode data could be released and for what benefit?</li>
<li>My data – provide individuals access to personal information about themselves that is held by the department.</li>
<li>Customer satisfaction/user experience – what do citizens think about services and how can departments engage with them?</li>
<li>Creation of a dynamic information market – having an infrastructure that supports the publication and use of information.</li>
<li>Continuous improvement – Ensuring the quality of data, releasing it in the right format.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The  question of cost, amount of resource, value and benefit of publishing Information Strategies was raised and in discussion it was clear that all aspects would need addressing when determining which datasets should be published. </li>
<li>It was suggested that Information Strategies be renamed to something more specific such as ‘Open Data Strategy’ or ‘Transparency Strategy’.</li>
</ul><p><strong>5.  Transparency Update</strong></p>
<ul><li> A brief presentation was given to provide a reminder of the context of transparency, and highlight progress to date.  Members of the SOG were also encouraged to visit <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.opengovpartnership.org/</a> for more information in particular the video available on the home page.</li>
<li>The Open Data Institute was announced in the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement and had the potential to play an important part in the Growth Review.  The ODI would be developed more fully between now and April 2012.</li>
<li>A new data-sharing task force had been established by the ESRC. A small number of departments had been invited to join.  A workshop on 16th January 2012 would consider the practicalities of their task.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Action:</strong></p>
<p><strong>-          Transparency Team to circulate White Paper presentation to Senior Officials.</strong></p>
<p><strong>-          Transparency Team to circulate details of the 16th January data sharing task force workshop.</strong></p>
<p> <strong>6.  Any Other Business</strong></p>
<ul><li>There were no items of any other business.</li>
</ul><p> The next meeting is Thursday 26th January, 10.00 – 11.30, Admiralty Arch, G45.</p>
