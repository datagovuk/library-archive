<p>A key commitment in last year’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-data-white-paper-unleashing-the-potential" rel="nofollow">Open Data White Paper</a> was the commission of an independent review of public sector information (PSI) which was launched in October 2012.</p>
<p>This review was launched in October 2012 by Stephan Shakespeare, Chair of the Data Strategy Board and CEO of YouGov, who we asked to look at our progress so far on opening up public data and to set out his assessment of how the Government should best use PSI to support economic growth. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/shakespeare-review-of-public-sector-information" rel="nofollow">His report</a> was published on 15 May 2013.</p>
<p>This is the government’s detailed response to the report’s conclusions and recommendations.</p>
