<p><strong>Funding Scotland</strong></p>
<p><em>Funding Scotland ues Open Data about funding to improve the process of identifying and communicating opportunties for VCS activity in Scotland.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://fundingscotland.com/" rel="nofollow">Funding Scotland</a> aims to improve the process of identifying and communicating funding opportunities in Scotland.  Its online platform provides a searchable resource for people in search of funds (‘fund seekers’) and enables funders to manage information about their programmes and build a direct, two-way relationship with their target audience.  Funding Scotland aspires to become the first point of reference for third sector organisations and members of the public looking for information on funding in Scotland.</p>
<p>Motivated by the prospect of reducing administrative costs for identifying and communicating funding information, Funding Scotland has the potential to make efficiency savings in the system.  The site also has useful links for organisations wishing to evaluate the economic and social impact of their work, as well as guides to making a successful application and project management.</p>
