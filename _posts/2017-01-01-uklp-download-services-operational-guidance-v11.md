<p>Download Services are the next step in enabling access to location data, allowing the underlying data in spatial data sets to be downloaded or, where practicable, accessed directly. As such these services are key to creating more opportunities for government, developers, businesses and individuals to exploit location data to improve decision making; and to develop innovative products and services.</p>
<p>Â In June 2012 the EU published their Technical Guidance for the implementation of INSPIRE Download Services. Since then we have been working on UK-specific guidance for the implementation of these services. This guidance has now been published as the UK Location Programme Download Service Operational Guide.</p>
<p>Authored and reviewed by a team of UK experts in the field, this guidance describes how to go about implementing a Download Service for spatial datasets. It outlines the various options that are available, provides guidance on which option to implement and when, and describes how to go about the detailed configuration of services. Whilst the specification of these services is driven by the INSPIRE guidance, the guide covers any Download Service implemented in support of the UK Location Strategy, and so is intended to provide guidance to all data publishers, for all datasets (not just those within scope of INSPIRE) that are published as part of that strategy.</p>
<p>Whilst every effort has been made to ensure this guidance is comprehensive and usable, we appreciate that it may not provide all the answers to questions which you may have about publishing a Download Service. So we would like to encourage feedback on any aspect of this guidance, which we will take on board and use to enhance the document in future releases. If you have any comments or suggestions about this document and its contents, please <a href="http://location.defra.gov.uk/resources/contact-us/" rel="nofollow">contact us</a>.</p>
