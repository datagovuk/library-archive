<ul><li>The White Paper will be published as the Open Data White Paper.</li>
<li>Following circulation and comment it has been submitted to PEX(ER) and sign off is anticipated for early the week commencing 18th June.</li>
<li>The current draft addresses all the substantive issues that were raised previously by PEX(ER).</li>
<li>A launch event is planned for 28th June at PA Consulting’s office on Buckingham Palace Road. All members of the Senior Officials’ Group are invited to attend. </li>
<li>Departmental Open Data Strategies will be published alongside the White Paper on the 28th June. They will all be available on the Cabinet Office website via a link to the document library on the new data.gov.uk.</li>
<li>Charlotte Alldritt in the Transparency Team has already been working closely with departments on specific aspects of some of the Open Data Strategies.</li>
<li>Simon French expressed his thanks to all the Senior Officials for their cooperation and contribution in developing the Open Data White Paper.</li>
<li>Post delivery of the Open Data White Paper, the Cabinet Office will commission the Open Data Institute (ODI) to conduct some analysis work on the impact of releasing data. </li>
<li>Separately there is a review of PSI which will feed into the work of the Open Data User Group.</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Open Data User Group</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>The Open Data User Group (ODUG) will represent the external (to government) users of Open Data.</li>
<li>Heather Savory (Twitter @SaturnSA4) was appointed the chair of ODUG last month. </li>
<li>The first ODUG event is being held on Thursday 14th June with the purpose of discussing how membership will work in practice.</li>
<li>ODUG will have £3.5million to spend on releasing data each year over the next two years. ODUG will focus on prioritising data from the trading funds but is expecting to receive a list of a large number of datasets which the Open Data community would like to be released. The process for unlocking datasets will require a strong business case. </li>
<li>The Open Data User Group will provide a more cohesive interface between the Open Data community and departments. It will also have a strong link with the Open Data Institute (ODI)</li>
<li>ODUG members will interact directly with the Sector Boards and encourage them to think about maximising the use of data that departments already hold as well to release new datasets.</li>
<li>ODUG is now inviting applications for membership. </li>
<li>Senior Officials can connect with ODUG via Twitter (@odugUK) and through their LinkedIn group.</li>
<li>The Senior Officials encouraged the Transparency Team to share information about the scope of the Data Strategy Board and how ODUG will interact with it. </li>

</ul><p><strong><em>Open Government Partnership</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>The Independent Reporting Mechanism, which will contribute to the monitoring and sustainability of the OGP is soon to be finalised: a concept paper has been submitted to the Steering Committee for approval and the recruitment process for the independent experts should start in the next few weeks.</li>
<li>The Open Government Partnership (OGP) strategy will be finalised by the end of June to include the UK co-chairmanship strategy. It will be endorsed by DfID, FCO and Cabinet Office ministers. </li>
<li>Francis Maude has given mandate to civil society organisation to establish a UK OGP Forum/Assembly, with the scope of providing both support and challenge during the UK co-chairmanship.</li>
<li>Preparations are underway for the next OGP Steering Committee meeting, which will be held in New York in September during the UN General Assembly ministerial week.</li>
<li>The next OGP Annual Conference will be in London in March 2013. </li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Action:</em></strong></p>
<p>-          <strong><em>Transparency Team to share information about the scope of the DSB and its interactions with the Open Data User Group.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>4.  The Open Data Institute: Stimulating a Dynamic Marketplace</strong></p>
<ul><li>Nigel Shadbolt discussed the rationale for developing a dynamic marketplace for Open Data. </li>
<li>Great strides have already been made by the UK government in enabling the release of data and developing accountability and transparency which is why the UK is a global leader.</li>
<li>An evidence base needs to be developed across all criteria and success stories need to be promoted.</li>
<li>The data that is released needs to be both usable and re-usable.</li>
<li>There is a lot of interest in Open Data from all sectors. Deloitte have written and published a report on Open Data. The Times have written a report on Big Data. </li>
<li>Private Sector companies are being increasingly open to hold themselves accountable and are publishing their data, e.g. Nike to show that their procurement methods are sustainable.</li>
<li>The Open Data Institute’s primary focus will be on incubation and innovation through Open Data. It will also build the evidence base, working alongside departments. </li>
<li>It will work with departments to determine which datasets should be released and to drive behavioural change.</li>
<li>The ODI Twitter account is @UKODI and the hashtag is #UKODI.</li>
<li>The Senior Officials observed that the evidence base should include the public benefits of Open Data, e.g. saving lives.</li>
<li>The Senior Officials questioned what the key barriers are to stimulating the market and if there is a better way to incentivise individual departments. </li>
<li>Nigel suggested departments include key performance indicators on data production into their performance management systems.</li>
<li>The Open Data Institute will work with departments to better understand what incentives means the most to them. </li>
<li>Departments are already identifying areas where they would want assistance from the ODI. </li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Action:</em></strong></p>
<p>-          <strong><em>Transparency Team to circulate Nigel Shadbolt’s slide set.</em></strong></p>
<p>-          <strong><em>Transparency Team to circulate the Deloitte report on Open Data.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Government Data – A Developer’s View</strong></p>
<ul><li> Jacqui Taylor, CEO of Flying Binary (<a href="http://www.flyingbinary.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flyingbinary.com/</a>), gave a presentation on what they, as developers, do, how they work with government and how they use government data. </li>
<li>Ian Taylor, CTO of Flying Binary, demonstrated their COINS tool.</li>
<li>Senior Officials found it useful to see how government data gets used in practice.</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Action:</em></strong></p>
<p>-          <strong><em>Transparency Team to circulate the slides from the Flying Binary presentation.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>6.  Any Other Business</strong></p>
<ul><li>There were no items of any other business.</li>
</ul><p> The next meeting is Thursday 19th July, 10.00 – 11.30</p>
