<ul><li>The Government Officials’ Forum met for the first time on 18th July. </li>
<li>Whilst some of the membership overlaps, the Government Officials’ Forum has distinctly different objectives to that of the Senior Officials’ Group. </li>
<li>The Government Officials’ Forum exists to specifically feed into the Data Strategy Board and the four trading funds wand with a focus on safeguarding critical services to ensure that there are no unintended consequences of releasing data sets. </li>
<li>Scopes of the various Data Boards needs to be kept tight in order to avoid overlap.</li>

<li>Not only is the revised portal sophisticated, the changes and updates in the technology have saved £160,000. </li>
<li>The next steps for data.gov.uk will include an inventory. </li>
<li>The inventory will provide explanations as to why a decision has been made not to publish a data set. </li>
<li>The inventory will also have voting buttons, allowing users to vote for the data sets they want to see. This information will be collated monthly and passed to the Open Data User Group. This will allow us to see what’s important to our customers. </li>
