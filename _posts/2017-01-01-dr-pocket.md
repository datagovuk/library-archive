<p><strong>Dr Pocket</strong></p>
<p><em>Dr Pocket is a company that uses public information about hospitals, doctors and organisations in health to help people find the best GP for them.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.drpocket.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Dr Pocket</a> was set up in 2011 with the aim of giving the public direct access to practical information about Hospitals, Doctors and any organisations working in health. Dr Pocket was created by Annette Garner and January Cervantes who have both worked in the health information sector and saw the positive effects of providing useful information from data. They believe there is a growing appetite for the public to access more health information as they become increasingly involved in their healthcare choices.</p>
<p>Dr Pocket launched its first app for the iPhone and iPad in October 2011 providing an overview of maternity services in London. The app uses data published by <a href="http://www.data.gov.uk/" rel="nofollow">Data.Gov.uk</a> that has been collated by NHS Hospitals.</p>
<p>The app 'Maternity Services in London' is available on the Apple App Store, and gives information that can help inform expectant Mums and Dads when they are selecting a maternity unit including:</p>
<ul><li>The number of births per midwife in post to indicate the workload of midwives in each unit.  </li>
<li>The number of C-sections and home births that occurred in that unit to show the frequency of these procedures.</li>
<li>The ability to compare this information and more across available services in London. </li>
</ul><p>Dr Pocket plans to use more publicly available data to incorporate into apps for people to use and is exploring a number of ideas that enable patients to access health services by using mobile technology.</p>
