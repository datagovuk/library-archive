<p><strong>Blue Plaque Guide</strong></p>

<p><em>London Blue Plaque Guide is an online map that shows the position and text of the blue plaques put up by English Heritage, marking the link between notable figures of the past and the buildings in which they lived and worked.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.plaqueguide.com/" rel="nofollow">London Blue Plaque Guide</a> was founded with seed funding by Ordnance Survey awarded in January 2010. As the third prize winner in the 2009 <a href="http://challenge.geovation.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">GeoVation Challenge</a>, Blue Plaque Guide was developed in collaboration with another start up (and fellow GeoVation finalists), <a href="http://www.geo.me/" rel="nofollow">geo.me</a>. The site enables users to search for <a href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/" rel="nofollow">Blue Plaque</a> sites located to mark houses across London – and, in time, other places across the world – where famous individuals have lived. </p>
<p>Blue Plaque Guide <a href="http://www.davidcoughlan.net/CV/ListSearch/BluePlaqueSearch.aspx" rel="nofollow">prototype</a> combined public data through Ordnance Survey maps (the current version uses googlemaps streetview) with active citizen crowdsourcing of further data and information: <em>“One of the major goals of this crowd-sourcing website is to source and store a large 'freshly-taken' royalty-free high-resolution photograph of every official plaque in London. That's why Plaque Guide is asking all schools in the south of England to invite their students to venture out of the class and to take a perfectly focused up-close picture of as many of their local plaques as possible.”</em></p>
