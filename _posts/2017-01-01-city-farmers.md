<p><a href="http://city-farmers.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">City Farmers</a> is a Community Interest Company that facilitates urban farming by helping identify the need for growing spaces; it helps local government engage individuals and communities through food and mapping. </p>
<p>Working with Lambeth, they have developed a number of multi-layer maps of Lambeth with growing projects, travel information, socio-economic data and accessibility. The Incredible Edible Lambeth shows existing and planned community growing areas in Lambeth, while How Green is Lambeth shows the access levels each area has to growing spaces. City Farmers maps are used to identify the needs for more growing spaces whilst also providing a focus point at community events to help individual groups see the bigger picture across the borough.</p>
<p>In addition to their work with Incredible Edible Lambeth, they have produced a series of maps based on socio-economic and transport data for urban exploration. Ordnance Survey data is combined with these indicators to assist explorers and place-makers in planning walks around London. The aim of these events is to compare physical geographies with socio-economic geographies and learn how these influence each other.</p>
<p>City Farmers latest mapping project is exploring ways which open data can be used to help ensure funding reaches the areas which need it most. Currently at the piloting stage, they have produced a hyper-local map set designed to demonstrate the comparative deprivation of the Vassell and Coldharbour wards of Lambeth. Not only will this support future funding applications but also provide guidance on the demographics within catchment areas of community projects. Support will be provided in identifying whether representative sections of the local community are being engaged through regular reporting and feedback provided to the organisations.</p>
<p>All City Farmers mapping projects use open government and <a href="http://www.data.gov.uk/library/Ordnance-Survey-Open-Data" rel="nofollow">Ordnance Survey</a> data and are produced using open source software allowing the organisation to develop projects for community groups without prohibitive licensing costs.</p>
