<p><strong>East of England Transport Information</strong></p>
<p><em>The East of England Transport Information project shows how data held by the public and private sector can be combined to improve the capacity of roads and generate economic growth.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/pvl/transport_information.pdf" rel="nofollow">The East of England Transport Information project</a> is based on an idea from the Department for Transports chief scientist in 2009 to use data sources to improve the capacity of roads.</p>
<p>Unforeseen incidents have a disproportionate effect on road operation. In particular the eastern section of the A14 a major international route for transport of goods to and from the port of Felixstowe. This section of read was scheduled for a multi-billion pound upgrade that was cancelled in the spending review.</p>
<p>By bringing together largely existing information sources and improving their usability, it is possible to reduce the duration, impacts and consequences of incidents, provide better information to users and provide intelligent modelling and decision making on diversionary routes. The data already exists but is not generally available for sharing and in multiple formats, creating a need to amalgamate real-time information with potentially commercially sensitive data and core reference data in real time.</p>
<p>Led by a Cambridge University emeritus professor of mathematics, it involves collaboration from Cambridge university, BT, the Department for Transport, Highways agency, local councils, emergency services, logistics companies and others. BT in particular have developed the data aggregation system at their own expense, and remarkably the entire scheme to date is not in receipt of central or local government funding.</p>
