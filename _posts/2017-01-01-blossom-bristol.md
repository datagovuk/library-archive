<p><strong>Blossom Bristol</strong></p>
<p><em>Blossom Bristol is an augmented reality game supported by Open Data that raises awareness of the environment in Bristol.</em></p>
<p><em>Â </em></p>
<p><em></em><a href="http://www.watershed.co.uk/dshed/blossom-bristol" rel="nofollow">Blossom Bristol</a> is an augmented reality game developed by <a href="http://www.mobilepie.com/" rel="nofollow">Mobile Pie</a>, a Bristol based development studio founded in 2008 that produces games and entertainment for mobile platforms.</p>
<p>Using Open Data released by <a href="/library/Bristol-B-Open-Datastore" rel="nofollow">Bristol City Council</a>, the project uses location-tied, live and historic data on a portable gaming platform to create an explorable virtual world. The game allows users to plant virtual crops at any location in Bristol, whose success or failure is dependent on real world environmental factors such as air and water quality, weather and temperature. Rewards and credits can be increased if players chose to shop locally or at farmers markets, supporting real world interaction. In doing so, the game encourages use of local facilities and raises awareness of local environmental issues. </p>
<p>The project also sought to encourage people to engage with data through play, and illuminate the relationship between information and the real, physical effects our actions have on the environment.</p>
