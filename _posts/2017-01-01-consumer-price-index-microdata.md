<p><strong> Consumer Price Index Microdata</strong></p>
<p><em>The Office of National Statistics now provides access to locally aggregated micro-data that underpins the Consumer Price Index, balancing commercial confidentiality with transparency.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/hub/index.html" rel="nofollow">The Office of National statistics</a> (ONS) produced the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a measure of the changes in the general level of prices charged for goods and services bought by UK householder for the purposes of consumption. The index is calculated from 180,000 price quotes collected monthly for 650 items from 20,000 retailers and service providers in 150 locations across the UK.</p>
<p>CPI is used the measure inflation to support the Bank of England’s monetary policy, indexing benefits, tax credits and public service pension, and in the calculation price escalation in private contracts. As a response to an FOI request, ONS now publishes the price quote data and item indices that underpin the CPI at a broadly geographic level have been made available for free use and re-use to the general public. The data cover the period from January 1996 to March 2011, and are updated once a quarter with a two month lag compared to the latest CPI publication.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the reliability of the data, ONS must provide confidentiality to retailers from which it obtains raw data in order to avoid putting them at a competitive disadvantage. Previously, 1-month percentage changes and 12 month percentage changes were published for total CPI and certain classes of product (e.g. bread &amp; cereals). However, lower level information (e.g. sliced white bread) and individual price quotes, ‘microdata’ although available for approved researchers, was not published in order to meet the confidentiality requirements of the retailers providing this data.</p>
<p>In response to an FOI request for microdata linked to geographical areas, ONS was able to provide this data at a level of geographical detail (NUTS 1) as low as possible while preventing identification of retailers.</p>
<p>The data have been well received; with over 8000 hits and user feedback indicates this is being used by expert CPI users to improve forecast models.</p>
