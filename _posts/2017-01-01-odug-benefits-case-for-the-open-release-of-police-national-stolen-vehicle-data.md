<p>As part of its current push on vehicle related data requests ODUG is today following up on the benefits case<a rel="nofollow" href="http://data.gov.uk/blog/odug-benefits-case-for-the-open-release-of-dvla-bulk-data">calling on the DVLA to release its bulk data as Open Data</a> under an Open Government License (OGL) with a similar benefits case calling for <strong><em>the release of the </em></strong><strong><em>Police Stolen Vehicle Data</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The release of this data would potentially result in less vehicle crime (through increased transparency), a higher rate of resolution of police stolen vehicle cases (through improved public engagement), safer roads (less stolen and uninsured vehicles on the roads) and reduced insurance claims/payouts. The estimated benefits to society of opening up this data are in excess of £2bn per annum.</em></strong></p>
