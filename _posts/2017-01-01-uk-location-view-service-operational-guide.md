<p>View Services allow data users to get a visual representation of location data. It is an overview of how the data looks rather than the full details.</p>
<p>The View Service Operational Guide v2.2 aims to set out the key details to operate an INSPIRE View Service as part of the UK Location Infrastructure.</p>
<p>There are a number of requirements of the INSPIRE View Service regulation that have a bearing on the setting up and running a View Service. This operational guide aims to walk through each of these requirements and make it easier for a Data Publisher to understand what is required.</p>
<p>The guide will be revised in the light of operational experience and feedback. YouÂ are encouraged to share your experiences with the UK Location Programme Team.</p>
