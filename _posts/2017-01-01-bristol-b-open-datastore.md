<p><strong>Bristol B-Open Datastore</strong></p>
<p><em>Bristol City Council’s B-Open project makes it easier for Bristol Council and the citizens of Bristol to share information.</em></p>
<p>Bristol City Council has been a pioneer and strong advocate for the potential positive impacts of digital technology on the engagement between general public and Local Authority, and on the social, economic and cultural positives of a connected City.</p>
<p>Through the <a href="http://www.bristol.gov.uk/page/bristols-b-open-datastore" rel="nofollow">B-Open</a> project steps are being taken to make it easier for Bristol Council and the citizens of Bristol to share information. B-Open is being used to promote transparency and increase public and neighbourhood engagement, providing open data to Bristol’s world famous creative industries to work with to create applications, websites, mobile products or installations which will have a positive impact on the people of Bristol.</p>
