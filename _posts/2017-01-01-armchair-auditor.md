<p><strong>Armchair Auditor</strong></p>
<p><em>Armchair Auditor is a website that uses the open spending data provided by councils to dynamically generate reports for users on council spending according to various criteria.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Windsor and Maidenhead Armchair Auditor uses the open data provided by the Royal Borough of <a href="/library/Windsor-and-Maidenhead-DataTap" rel="nofollow">Windsor and Maidenhead</a>, free for use and reuse. It was designed and written independently from the council by an independent developer, Adrian Short, who provides the software open source (it has been used to build <a href="/library/UpNorthAuditor" rel="nofollow">UpNorthAuditor</a> and Isle of Wight Armchair Auditor).</p>
<p>Armchair Auditor breaks down spending by council service, and provides both a high-level view of how much money is being spent by each council service or paid to each supplier, but also allows visitors to examine the details right down to individual payments. Visitors are able to discuss spending on comment threads attached to council service, supplier and individual payment so that additional information and opinions can be added by visitors. It has also been designed to print well, and allow visitors to download the spending data as CSV files to be analysed further.</p>
