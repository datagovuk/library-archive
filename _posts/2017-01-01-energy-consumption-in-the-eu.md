<p><strong>Energy Consumption in the EU</strong></p>
<p><em>Energy Consumption in the EU uses Open Data in the form of EU statistics to map how EU member states are performing against their emission reduction targets.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The energy consumption in the EU is another Open Knowledge Foundation project, which maps data (mainly from official Eurostat statistics) on how the EU’s member states are performing against their agreed targets to reduce emissions, cut energy consumption by 20% and increase the share of renewables in the energy mix to 20% by 2020.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://energy.publicdata.eu/ee/" rel="nofollow">Europe's Energy</a> project gives users a set of visual tools to put these targets into context and to understand and compare how progress is being made towards them in different countries.</p>
