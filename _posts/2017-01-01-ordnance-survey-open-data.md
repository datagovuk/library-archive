<p><em>Ordnance Survey provides a selection of mapping data, such as administrative boundaries and postcode data as Open Data at its online datastore, helping make it easier to develop useful mapping and location based applications and tools.</em></p>
<p>On 1 April 2010, <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Ordnance Survey</a> launched <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/products/os-opendata.html" rel="nofollow">OS OpenData</a>, the service that made a selection of mapping datasets for Great Britain available for commercial or non-commercial use without restriction. This meant that the Ordnance Surveyâ€™s mapping and geographic information, such as administrative boundaries and postcode data, which had previously have been subject to royalty payments and restrictions on re-use, would now be available for free.</p>
<p>Three of those key datasets have been released as Linked Data. In addition, a range of developer tools and activities have been delivered, open standards have been adopted, as have Open Source software tools to deliver the data through web services. The launch of the OS OpenData service has not only helped to promote government transparency; it also underpins a range of independently developed software applications. 80% of data has a location element to it, so geographic and location data is key for putting most data into context and building useful applications and services.</p>
<p>By making mapping and geographic information freely available for download, third party developers can easily include scrollable and scalable Ordnance Survey maps within their applications, or use the OS OpenSpace API (Application Programming Interface) to create interactive web maps. Many websites and applications draw on OS OpenData: <a href="http://www.data.gov.uk/library/FIND" rel="nofollow">FIND</a>, <a href="http://www.data.gov.uk/library/Duedil" rel="nofollow">Duedil</a>, <a href="http://www.data.gov.uk/library/Blue-Plaque-Guide" rel="nofollow">Blue Plaque Guide</a>, <a href="http://www.data.gov.uk/library/icoast" rel="nofollow">icoast</a> and <a href="http://www.data.gov.uk/library/Windsor-and-Maidenhead-DataTap" rel="nofollow">Windsor and Maidenhead DataTap</a>. Ordnance Survey also hosts the <a href="http://challenge.geovation.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">Geovation Challenge</a>, supporting new geography based business ventures that have an economic, social or environmental benefit for the country. GeoVation does this by running themed challenges addressing real world issues by finding the most innovative use of OS OpenData.</p>
