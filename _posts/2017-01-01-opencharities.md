<p><strong>OpenCharities</strong></p>
<p><em>OpenCharities is a datastore of information about charities: their register number, contact details, aims and accounts.</em></p>

<p>Produced by the people behind <a href="/library/OpenlyLocal" rel="nofollow">OpenlyLocal</a> and <a href="/library/OpenCorporates" rel="nofollow">OpenCorporates</a>, <a href="http://opencharities.org/" rel="nofollow">OpenCharities</a> seeks to provide the same services for charities that these other sites do for the world of local authorities and companies. </p>
<p>The project arose out of a need to match charities and their registration numbers to council spending data published on <a href="/library/OpenlyLocal" rel="nofollow">OpenlyLocal</a>, OpenCharities now has data on 320,000 charities, and provides a list of Charities, their contact details, aims and their accounts. This can facilitate tools to track grants and organisations, such as the demonstration map of <a href="http://esme.practicalparticipation.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Esmee Fairbairn’s grants</a> with Charities register data.</p>
<p>Combining data from OpenCharities and OpenCorporates doubled the number of charities linked to companies compared with the Charity Commission’s own data, and found that many had been closed as companies but appeared on the register as live charities, demonstrating the power that open data can have to facilitate better analysis and improved quality of data.</p>
