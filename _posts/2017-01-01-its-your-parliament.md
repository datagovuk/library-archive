<p><strong>It’s Your Parliament</strong></p>
<p><em>It’s Your Parliament draws on Open Data published by the European Parliament to help make the European Parliament more transparent to voters.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.itsyourparliament.eu/" rel="nofollow">It’s Your Parliament</a> makes transparent the votes cast in the European Parliament and enables the public to find and compare voting records of members of the European Parliament (MEPs) and political groups.  It also allows for active citizen participation by posting online comments and casting votes.  The site tracks public ‘likes’ and ‘dislikes’ of members’ voting records and their views (‘for’ or ‘against’) on proposals raised in the European Parliament.  As well as a rolling news and information section, It’s Your Parliament allows users to create and edit a personal account with details of your own voting record on the site.</p>
