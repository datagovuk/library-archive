<p><strong>Placr School Browser</strong></p>
<p><em>Placr have developed an online tool to help people understand the performance of their local schools.</em></p>
<p>Every year the Department of Education releases performance tables for schools and colleges in England for three stages of learning: Primary School (Key Stage 2), Secondary School (GCSE and equivalent) and School and College (Key Stage 5). <a href="/library/Placr" rel="nofollow">Placr’s</a> <a href="http://www.schoolbrowser.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">School Browser</a> enables users to visualise this data a local neighbourhood, city, county and country level.  By aggregating the performance data automatically, users can compare schools at any scale of their choosing.</p>
<p>A colour coded ‘heat map’ shows performance from worst (deepest red), through average (neutral colours) to the best (deepest green).  Benchmarks for national averages and percentiles are included for reference and Placr encourages users to contact them if data points do not seem to match with their experience and opinion of education in the area or a particular school.</p>
