<p><strong>myhealthlondon</strong></p>
<p><em>myhealthlondon is an NHS website showing how GP practices are performing against national standards and how they compare with other London GP practices, helping people find the best GP for them.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.myhealth.london.nhs.uk/" rel="nofollow">myhealthlondon</a> shows how GP practices are performing against national standards and how they compare with other London practices.  Each practice has its own myhealthlondon webpage, which can be tailored to showcase their work and keep the public informed about clinics and services.  The internal intranet also gives access to a ‘marketplace’ of information and tools to support GPs and the site has links to enable online repeat prescription orders and appointment bookings.</p>
<p>By March 2012, three months after launch, more than a third of GP practices in London have registered.  In a recent survey 67% of GPs said they liked the site, which has received nearly 28,000 unique visits.</p>
<p>The £120,000 project was developed with input from the local medical committees, clinical commissioning groups and independent practices.  Speaking to <a href="http://www.ehi.co.uk/news/ehi/7649/third-of-london-gps-use-myhealthlondon" rel="nofollow">E-Health Insider</a>, one of the GPs who helped to develop the site said: <em>“I have had some very good feedback from patients who have used it. We have redirected our practice website to that page, so patients will go straight to the page and be able to navigate from there.”</em></p>
