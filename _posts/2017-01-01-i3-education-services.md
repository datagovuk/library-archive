<p><strong>i3 Education Services</strong></p>
<p><em>i3 Education Services draws on Open Data to provide analytics services to education providers.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.i3datacloud.com" rel="nofollow">i3 Education Services</a> is a 2010 start up based in East London.  As a private company, it works with over 20 associates and partners across three key areas:</p>
<ul><li>Education &amp; skills funding, quality and performance</li>
<li>i3 Analytics: data dashboards and business intelligence support for schools, colleges and local government using open data and cloud technology</li>
<li>Local government, schools, and FE shared and traded services</li>
<li>i3 Education Services aims to bring precision to the use of open data in education and skills through cutting edge analytics, co-design with the user community, and the creation of an education data app store.  Chief Executive of i3, Sean Mahoney, explains that the company’s mission is to become the <em>“Bloomberg of education and skills data”</em>.  </li>
</ul><p>To add value to open data and analytics in the education and skills sector i3 has developed ‘The Open Data Cloud’.  This cloud based platform enables collaboration, knowledge sharing, networking and app development.   It is based on three key design features:</p>
<ul><li>Elegant organisation: i3 assembles, organise and visualise emerging open data from the education sector and align it with other data to create a 360° picture.</li>
<li>Networked experts: i3 hosts a growing social network of education data users and experts who group around that data.  Issues regarding the data, its interpretation and uses can hence be the focus of critical discussion and creative exchange. </li>
<li>App development lab: As the community and range of data has expanded, new insights and methods of interpreting and presenting the information are emerging all the time.  i3 is now supporting the development of new tools and apps (based on open data) which can be tested through the user community.</li>
</ul><p>I3’s work in education and skills hinges upon data.  The firm describes data as the <em>“life-blood”</em> of the sector since it drives funding and can enhance provider performance and intelligent planning.  Speaking on the impact of the current fiscal climate and more risk averse management context, i3 notes that <em>“schools and colleges need more robust insights and better benchmarking data than ever before.”</em></p>
