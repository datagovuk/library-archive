<p><strong>Popular bicycle routes in London</strong></p>
<p><em>A visualisation using Transport for London data to show the most popular cycle routes in London using Barclays Cycle Hire bikes.</em></p>
<p>In December 2010, <a href="/library/London-DataStore" rel="nofollow">Transport for London</a> released the data on the first 1.4 million journeys made with the bikes of the <a href="/library/RedSpottedHanky" rel="nofollow">Barclays Cycle Hire</a> scheme during the period of first 3 months. This <a href="http://borisbikes.saltaku.com/" rel="nofollow">visualisation</a> shows all routes together, most popular 500 routes, also for each of the 351 docking stations has their own 2 visualisations, for in-coming and out-coming routes.</p>
<p>The map displays the approximate routes made by cyclists, allowing identification of the busiest road segments (Waterloo Bridge) and identifying where additional cycle lanes may be needed.</p>
