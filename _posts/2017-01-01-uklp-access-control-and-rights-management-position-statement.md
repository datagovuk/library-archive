<p>This position statement is the result of work by the UK Location Business Interoperability Working Group in 2012. The Group, which has wide cross-government membership, considered how to develop an approach to best tackle the problem of the lack of interoperability in the digital rights management of services providing location data to users. The UK Location Programme Board agreed the approach set out in the document.</p>
