<p>This draft of the UK’s second National Action Plan  is a result of the UK’s membership of the Open Government Partnership  (OGP) - a multilateral initiative  that aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote  transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new  technologies to strengthen governance.  The UK is one of eight founding  members of the OGP which was launched formally in September 2011 (the  remaining founding partners are: Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Norway,  Philippines, South Africa, and the United States). There are now 59  governments in the OGP. To become a member, participating countries  must: embrace a high-level Open Government Declaration; deliver a  country action plan developed with public consultation; and commit to  independent reporting on their progress going forward.   </p>
<p>This is the  UK’s second National Action Plan.  It is a draft and interim plan that  is out for public consultation in line with the requirements laid down  by the OGP. This draft plan has been produced through a collaborative  multi-stakeholder process involving members of the OGP Civil Society  Network and government departments.</p>
<p>We very much welcome views on the commitments made in this draft plan, ideally supported by evidence wherever possible.</p>
<p>The closing date for consultation responses is 19  September. Please note however that this is an iterative process and  views and comments will be taken into consideration as we develop the  draft plan over the coming months into a final version, ready for  publication by 31 October 2013. Views that are supported by evidence  will be given more standing than those without.  Members of the OGP  Civil Society Network will analyse the responses in collaboration with  Her Majesty’s Government. </p>
