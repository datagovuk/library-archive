<p><strong>Which? Informed Student</strong></p>
<p><em>The consumer champion ‘Which?’ is developing an online tool that will use Open Data to help students pick the best university and course for them.</em></p>
<p>The consumer champion, Which?, believes that higher education is a valuable experience, with a life-long impact on individuals. Which? is developing a comprehensive, independent online information and advice service, that will be freely available, to empower students. Choosing the right course at the right university is now more complex than ever and Which? is seeking to help students make the best choice for them. </p>
<p>The service will  help students to navigate the six key decision making stages when making higher education choices: narrowing down  the options, the process of getting to university, understanding the student experience, making the right financial plans, making  an informed choice based on information and advice, and leaving with the best prospects.</p>
<p>Using data from official sources such as UCAS, HESA, DLHE and the LFS, Which? will present this data  alongside contextual information, such as  how to read between the lines when it comes to student satisfaction ratings and what graduate employment figures really reveal. The service will feature a decision engine that allows students to narrow down their options according to their personal needs and will provide real-life insights into the world of university.</p>
<p>The aim is to provide the right tools, in the right place, to help individuals take ownership of their higher education choices.</p>
