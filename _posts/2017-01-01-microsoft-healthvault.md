<p><strong>Microsoft HealthVault</strong></p>
<p><em>Microsoft HealthVault helps people hold, control and share their personal health data in a secure manner, helping them better manage their healthcare.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/healthvault/" rel="nofollow">Microsoft HealthVault</a> is an example of an existing application providing a series of added-value services such as organising information in one place and monitoring long-term health conditions.</p>
<p>Microsoft has estimated that around a quarter of citizens in other EU countries actively manage their health. They believe that if UK take-up was in line with the rest of Europe this could deliver savings of up to £6bn to the NHS directly as well as additional benefits to the wider economy through lower sickness and absenteeism, as an example.</p>
