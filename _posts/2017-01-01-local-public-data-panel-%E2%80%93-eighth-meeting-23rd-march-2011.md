<p><strong>Other Attendees:</strong><strong> </strong>Melanie Sturtevant (DCLG), David Kane (NCVO) – both for item on Community Ownership of Data)</p>
<p><strong>Secretariat:</strong><strong> </strong>Philip Worsfold and Padma Juggapah.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Item 1: Minutes, Matters Arising</strong></p>
<p>Minutes of the 9th February 2011 meeting were agreed.</p>
<p><strong>Item 2: Actions report</strong></p>
<p>Hulya Mustafa updated on progress against previous actions.</p>
<p><strong>VAT/Fraud </strong></p>
<p>HM Treasury’s review of publication of VAT registration number (VRN) and the perceived risk of fraud if VRN were published was ongoing.  HMT would provide a report summing up their recent analysis before confirming the final position.  The Panel recommended that views should be sought from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) and others involved in systems to prevent fraud.    </p>
<p><strong>Action: DCLG to obtain advice from CIPFA.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Public Data/Private Companies </strong></p>
<p>A position statement remained important. Small amendments to the Freedom of Information Act were progressing through Parliament and a broader FOI Review would soon commence</p>
<p><strong>Action: Panel</strong> <strong>members to develop a position statement (Chris Taggart/Janet Hughes).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Local Authority Expenditure Data</strong></p>
<p>The Local Government Group provided the following breakdown of local authority activities relating to expenditure data. Information for February showed:</p>
<ul><li>353 out of 354 local authorities had published their expenditure      details</li>
<li>231 authorities published spending details in CSV format</li>
<li>82 published in Excel format</li>
<li>8 published in XML format</li>
<li>228 also published as .pdf format</li>
<li>57 authorities published as .pdf format only</li>
</ul><p>It was a concern that only 179 local authorities were publishing under the Open Government Licence. Not confirming a license meant, by default, that the data was not available for re-use.</p>
<p><strong>Action: Local Government Group to remind local authorities to use the open government license.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Redesign of data.gov.uk</strong></p>
<p>Cabinet Office work was ongoing to re-assess the vision for the data.gov.uk site.  The Panel considered the primary purpose of the site needed to remain as a data catalogue. It should not be the Government’s role to create new apps and build websites but to enable others to do so.</p>
<p>The Cabinet Office would circulate a paper on their vision for data.gov.uk at a future meeting. </p>
<p><strong>Action: Panel to develop view and place on data.gov.uk Local Public Data Panel blog</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Crime Data </strong></p>
<p>Ongoing work was needed to support the trail blazing areas established after the initial release of crime data, and to encourage others (including other service sectors) to see the benefits of being more transparent.</p>
<p><strong>Capital Assets Pathfinders</strong></p>
<p>The Local Government Group had taken on responsibility for the 11 CAP areas.  There had been some positive work to map public assets but issues remained with the OS Master Map. Some good work was being done in Kirklees via a NESTA funded project to develop and online tool called 'Who Owns My Neighbourhood'.  This used land ownership data, where residents could add and discuss information about their area and keep up to date with solutions to local land problems such as fly-tipping.</p>
<p><strong>Public Data Corporation</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Panel’s previous discussion on the PDC had been passed to the Secretary of State.  Cabinet Office Ministers would make a statement in autumn 2011 on the policy of access to open data. The PDC was referred to in the Budget Statement 2011 which confirmed the government was considering the merits of machinery of government changes to facilitate the development of the PDC. First steps might also include establishing a Shadow Board and creation of an inventory of datasets from key data-holding organisations. The inventory policy statement was due for completion by April 2011.</p>
<ul><li>The composition of the PDC Shadow Board was important. It was likely to need to operate transparently</li>
<li>Open consideration of the PDC was essential. Its impact would extend beyond the trading fund model. </li>
<li>There needed to be work to determine how public data was valued, who decided that value and for a national framework to be established</li>
</ul><p><strong>Action: Nigel Shadbolt to reflect Panel views to the Public Sector Transparency Board.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Code of Practice on Local Authority Data Transparency</strong></p>
<p>A report had been circulated on the DCLG consultation. The Department received 216 direct responses before the deadline of 14th March with a further 30 posts to an online forum.  The review of the responses was continuing and a final response would be issued by the Department in due course. </p>
<ul><li>The proposed Code represented a further      way the Government intended to shift the balance of public good toward      transparency and release of data.</li>
<li>The proposed Code would be      introduced into a crowded legal and regulatory context so it was important      not to duplicate requirements. This was especially important as the      Protection of Freedoms Bill passed through Parliament</li>
</ul><p><strong>Arms Length Bodies</strong></p>
<p>The Panel‘s guidance on safeguarding ALB data had been published on data.gov.uk and linked to the broader guidance on ALB reform.  A link to the guidance had been included in a ‘checklist’ the Cabinet Office produced for all closing public bodies.  This checklist had been circulated to relevant governmental networks.  DCLG had also produced and published online an ALB data legacy note:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/albdatalegacy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/albdatalegacy</a></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Action: DCLG to list ALB data sets being published/released in the form of a dashboard output to data.gov.uk </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Making a Difference with Data project</strong> </p>
<p>A paper on progress had been circulated and a policy briefing on 18 March had been well attended by over 60 delegates from the open data community, local authorities, government departments, think tanks, voluntary organisations and community activists. Some campaigning work was needed to move the agenda beyond spend data.  £19k was potentially available to gather further content and secure longer term sustainability for the project.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Action: DCLG to confirm potential to use under spend. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Item 3: Community Ownership of Data</strong></p>
<p>Melanie Sturtevant updated the Panel on provisions to introduce a Community Right to Challenge and Community Right to Buy in the Localism Bill. These Rights were intended to provide community and voluntary bodies, parish councils and authority employees the ability to take on the running of state services. A council would be required to properly consider a proposal before either accepting it and running a procurement process or publicly stating why the proposal had been rejected. The Bill was focussed on all county and district councils and London Boroughs but with the power to extend to other public bodies.  DCLG was currently consulting on this provision and the policy team welcomed Panel advice on how open data could support operation of the new Rights.</p>
<ul><li>The exchange of data between organisations was essential. In order for an organisation to provide effective bids to run services councils, in particular, needed to provide all the necessary information.</li>
<li>Small community groups were less likely to be able to compete with larger organisations that were specifically set up to win contracts.  It was therefore essential that the reasons for rejecting bids were published in an open and transparent way.</li>
<li>There were already examples where citizens were using data to run services parallel to state provision. In Birmingham, residents had reworked the City Council’s website in response to a multi-million pound contract.</li>
<li>Running multiple, smaller scale procurement processes would not allow efficiencies of scale for local authorities.</li>
<li>Within the procurement process data would be held by the client, current suppliers and potential bidders. The data balance favoured current suppliers and it was therefore vital for all information to be available to support genuine competition.</li>
<li>Data produced as a consequence of succeeding in the procurement process should be open. This expectation should be made clear to all parties at the outset of the challenge.</li>
<li>Organisations would need to know what information would be required to back up an expression of interest. There had to be a low bar for organisations to meet and an obligation of support for smaller organisations.</li>
<li>In relation to the community right to buy it was essential for bidding processes were entirely transparent and embedded in the planning regime. There needed to be transparency on land use classes, neighbourhood plans and designation of land.</li>
<li>NCVO had an interest in opening up data held by charities themselves and how they could combine it with other sets. There were a number of challenges here: skills within the sector to produce and use open data – this applied to large national charities as much as small community groups, finding out what was held by charities and the need for data standards to emerge. There was an opportunity for NCVO to get members interested in open data.</li>
<li>A key question was how to stimulate charities to become engaged. The Charity Commission’s strategic review needed to focus on open data; charities themselves needed to see that data use provided an effective campaigning tool.</li>
<li>The DataBridge project in Brighton was a collaborative project under development looking at how the voluntary sector could make best use of central and local government data being released, to explore it and combine it with their own information</li>
<li>Some charities received large amounts of public funding and tax payers had an interest in how it was being used.</li>
<li>These were also issues of community ownership of data and accountability whilst safeguarding anonymity.  This could be solved through effective governance levels and elected members had a vital role to play to reinforce the democratic process. The Centre for Public Scrutiny could help effectively shape this agenda.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Item 4: Future Panel Activity</strong></p>
<p>The Chair reminded the meeting that the Panel had been set up for a 2 year period concluding in September 2011. With 6 months remaining it was now appropriate to take stock of the future agenda, particularly as other sector panels were being proposed by the Cabinet Office.</p>
<p>It had been important and helpful for the Public Sector Transparency Board to have a Panel specifically looking at the release of local data which were also central to the Government’s localism agenda.</p>
<p>If the Panel was to continue longer term the following issues needed to be addressed:</p>
<ul><li>Clarity on what levers were available to the Panel to influence the local data agenda</li>
<li>Fit with the Cabinet Office’s overall strategy for Transparency</li>
<li>The ability to support community engagement and demand for local data </li>
</ul><p>Janet Hughes tabled a diagram (see attached) of the open data ecosystem, showing where the Panel could add value and how, for example, identifying gaps in the ecosystem and helping bring people together to fill them.</p>
<p><strong>Action: Chair to write, on behalf of the Panel, to Ministers reviewing progress and to request further support from DCLG.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Item 5: Any Other Business</strong></p>
<p>Tim Allen updated on plans for a Local Open Data Hack Day on Saturday 11th June. This was intended to raise awareness of local open data sets, publication standards and capacity building.</p>
<p>Roger Hampson thanked the Panel for comments on the Redbridge DataStore, which launched on 24th March.  Further views, particularly on marketing the DataStore, were welcomed.</p>
<p>Chris Taggart and Tim Allen to discuss possible development of open elections project.</p>
<p><strong>Date of Future Meeting:</strong></p>
<p>24th May 2011, 14:00-16.30 <strong>(subject to confirmation)</strong></p>
