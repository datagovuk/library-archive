<p>This report provides an overview of the datasets Data Providers plan to publish in UK for INSPIRE on 25 May 2012. The report lists datasets that contain some or a majority of spatial objects defined by INSPIRE data specifications.</p>
<p>The report is produced for the UK Location Programme Board and is updated regularly. The report is published more widely to share knowledge and to provide guidance to potential Data Providers.</p>
<p>The data in the report has been collated from a wide range of sources, including 1:1 conversations with Data Providers; Theme Group discussions; The 2011 INSPIRE Monitoring Report; and suggestions from third parties (e.g. Board members).</p>
<p>The positions/decisions documented in the report do not represent policy and are in no way binding. The report is provided without warranty. The report is not suitable for use as a measure of performance.</p>
<p>The responsibility for selection and publication of datasets rests with Data Providers. The UK Location Programme works closely with Data Providers to ensure a coordinated approach is taken for each INSPIRE Theme in the UK and that decisions are as consistent as possible.</p>
