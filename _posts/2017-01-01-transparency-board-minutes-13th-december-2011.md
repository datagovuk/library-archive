<p>Nigel Shadbolt updated the Board on the work underpinning the Autumn Statement intent to establish an Open Data Institute by 31 March 2012.  He summarised key areas which will be discussed and determined over the next few months.  These included:</p>

<p><strong>Open Government Partnership</strong></p>
<p>TK updated the Board on his attendance of the Open Government Partnership event in Brasilia on 6-8 December.  He reported: </p>
<ul><li>The event had been a success: 50 countries had participated, and of these 20 countries were very keen to be involved.</li>
<li>There will be another event in Brasilia in the spring, provisionally 16-18 April, at which the UK could have a lead role, in anticipation of the UK’s co-chairmanship with Brazil in 2012.</li>
<li>The Open Government Partnership work highlights the general trend for an increased demand for the UK to participate in bilateral/engagement work.  The ongoing resource for this work is likely to require cross-departmental support.</li>
</ul><p>In response to these points the Transparency Board commended the international dimension to the Cabinet Office team’s work.  They also stated that <em>their</em> primary objective was to ensure there would be legislative policy changes in the UK to ensure the concept of open data could not be ‘undone’.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> To issue the Transparency Board with a detailed note of the outcomes from the Open Government Partnership meeting in Brasilia 6-8 December 2011</p>
<p><strong>Due:</strong> January</p>

<p>Farah Ahmed, Head of Right to Data Policy Implementation, Cabinet Office, reported to the Board on the delayed publication of the European Commission Communication on Open Data, including proposals to the revision of the Public Sector Information Directive. She made the following points: </p>
<ul><li>Cabinet Office has a role in responding to this European Commission Communication alongside The National Archives;</li>
<li>UK Government is required to respond with a memorandum in early January stating the policy implications to the UK.</li>
<li>The revisions to the PSI Directive will change domestic legislation.</li>
<li>The proposed changes to the Public Sector Information Directive will include cultural data, with the addition of libraries and museums; and the encouragement for each member state to create on open data portal.</li>
</ul><p>The Transparency Board commented that proactive work should lead on ‘free’ open data and also that existing UK policy current goes beyond what the EC is proposing.  </p>

<p><strong>Due: </strong>December</p>
