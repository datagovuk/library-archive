<p><strong>Scottish Longitudinal Study</strong></p>
<p><em>The Scottish Longitudinal Study provides a high quality, longitudinal research dataset that can be used to provide insight into the health and social status of a large sample of the Scottish population and how it changes over time.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.lscs.ac.uk/sls/" rel="nofollow">The Scottish Longitudinal Study</a> (SLS) provides a high quality, longitudinal research dataset that can be used to provide an insight into the health and social status of a large sample of the Scottish population (5.3%) and how it changes over time.</p>
<p>The study links data from the decennial censuses, vital events registrations, hospital records, cancer registrations, and educational data, which together provide a range of cultural, demographic, economic, health, housing and social variables.  The sample size is large compared to most surveys or panel studies, and because it is based on routinely collected administrative data sample attrition rates are extremely low and linkage rates for events is high. Consequently, a range of important studies are possible which have could not previously have been explored and these include research on: social mobility, health inequalities, population migration and housing transitions.</p>
<p>Individual confidentiality is a defining principle of the SLS.  The study is located in a state-of-the-art safe haven in the National Records of Scotland in Edinburgh and strict governance arrangements are in place, which mean that every planned study is carefully scrutinised before the research in undertaken.  Those bona fide researchers whose research proposals are accepted are invited to undertake their analyses in the safe haven, or they can submit statistical code to the SLS support team for them to run on the data – individual level records are never released to researchers.</p>
