<p><strong>Birmingham Civic Dashboard</strong></p>
<p><em>The Birmingham Civic Dashboard combines public data with civil engagement, helping bring residents and the council together to identify and solve problems.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.civicdashboard.org.uk" rel="nofollow">The Birmingham Civic Dashboard</a>, funded by Nesta, is one of the first UK projects combining public data and civil engagement. The application, developed by Digital Birmingham and <a href="http://www.data.gov.uk/library/Mudlark" rel="nofollow">Mudlark</a> takes live data from the city's Customer First contact database and shows trends on an online map, allowing the council and residents to identify 'hotspot' areas where there are common or recurring issues, reported to the council, such as housing repairs and missed waste collections.</p>
<p>It thus enables Birmingham City Council and local residents to discuss issues and identify trends in the community. Raj Mack, Head of Digital Birmingham said <em>"Putting our data to use in this novel and interactive way will enable our Customer First team to look at new ways of involving local people in transforming the delivery of our services, and get to the root causes of customer complaints and particular issues."</em></p>
<p><a title="Digital Birmingham" href="//www.digitalbirmingham.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Digital Birmingham</a> was established in 2006 as the driving force to ensure that the benefits of digital and emerging technologies are available to all sectors in the city, which is key to accelerating Birmingham and the region’s economic and social well being. Through its investment in technology and infrastructure and world class connectivity programme, it is building on its digital credentials and is at the heart of driving forward Birmingham’s Smart City approach and to extend this across the Local Enterprise Partnership. This aims to ensure that technology and digital is strategically integrated across city initiatives, to enable better city planning &amp; decision making; stimulate innovation and support new business models for service delivery and provision.</p>
