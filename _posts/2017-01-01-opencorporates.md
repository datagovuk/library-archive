<p><strong>OpenCorporates</strong></p>
<p><em>OpenCorporates, along with its sisters OpenCharities and OpenlyLocal, represent a huge datastore of information on companies, charities and local authorities respectively.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://opencorporates.com/" rel="nofollow">OpenCorporates</a> is the world’s largest open database of company data. Launched 18 months ago, it has grown from 3 million companies to over 40 million companies and from 3 jurisdictions to over 50: from Britain to Bermuda, Spain to Singapore, Alaska to Albania. Its aim is to create an entry for every legal corporate entity in the world,</p>
<p>Allowing searches across all jurisdictions, with filtering by company type, status, country and many other attributes, the website is both simple to use facilitating sophisticated filtering and access to data.</p>
<p>In addition, OpenCorporates is matching other public data to the companies involved, from creditor notices to health &amp; safety violations, trademarks to the data protection register, official registers and government spending data, and in doing so has helped government bodies identify errors in their own data.</p>
<p>OpenCorporates is increasingly getting the information directly from company registers, and helped Companies House develop its new URI system to identify companies.</p>
<p>OpenCorporates allows direct access to its data through an open API (Application Programming Interface), and provides the ability to use data cleansing tools such as Google Refine to match other datasets to companies, and is already being used by diverse groups such as journalists, organisations such as <a href="/library/Where-does-my-money-go" rel="nofollow">OpenSpending</a>, and even government departments around the world.</p>
<p>OpenCorporates’ co-founder, Chris Taggart, said, <em>“In a global world, where companies are actually complex networks of corporate legal entities, it critical that people have not just free access to company data, but the right to freely reuse it and combine it with other data.  When financial crises strike, or disasters such as the Gulf Oil spill happen, it takes months or years to unpick the various corporate entities that form the large groups involved. OpenCorporates massively simplifies that job. At the other end of the scale, OpenCorporates makes it trivial to search for cross-border information on small and medium-sized companies information that is often difficult to get from any other source.”</em></p>
