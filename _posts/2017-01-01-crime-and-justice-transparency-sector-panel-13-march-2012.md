<p><strong>1. Welcome </strong></p>
<p>Kieron O’Hara welcomed attendees and brief introductions were given.</p>
<p><strong>2. Minutes and update on action points at last meeting</strong></p>
<p>Actions from meetings prior to 13 December:</p>
<p>Action 1: Rebecca Bradfield, Iain Bell, Emer Coleman and Will Perrin to meet and discuss local level testing of data releases.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Not 	to be taken forward. Iain Bell agreed that this will be borne in 	mind for the May release of justice outcome information.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Action 2: Simon Denison to investigate international best practice on publicising crime and justice information.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Complete. 	Simon Denison updated the group by saying that the UK is the world 	leader in terms of national provision of information to the public 	on justice system performance. Will Perrin thought that local 	provision would have been a more useful measure; his concerns were 	noted.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Action 3: Rebecca Bradfield to progress a refresh of the transparency principles and distribute them at the next meeting.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Not 	to be taken forward. Work on departmental Open Data Strategies (due 	for publication in the Spring) will supercede this action.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Action 4: Kieron O’Hara to co-ordinate the development of a specification for an open court for consideration by the SPJ.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Complete. 	Will Perrin’s open court charter is a useful starting point and 	the issues it raises were discussed by the panel, including by the 	Office of the SPJ, at the 13 December panel meeting.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Minutes of meeting of 13 December are available on data.gov.uk.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1</strong>: Simon Denison to provide data on hit rates to the Making Sense of Criminal Justice site and downloads on justice.gov.uk </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Partially 	complete. Simon will provide the data with these minutes..</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Action 2</strong>: Simon Denison to talk to the MoJ Digital Team and request a link is provided.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Complete. 		Links are already provided at the bottom of the statistics pages on 		the Open Justice microsite (‘About these statistics’ links).</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Action 3</strong>: Kieron O’Hara to circulate the URL for his report on anonymisation testing once completed.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Complete.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Action 4</strong>: Simon Denison to request comments from panel members on the strategic narrative paper out of committee.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Complete. 		Draft narrative is to be discussed at item 6.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Action 5</strong>: Farah Ahmed to supply a contact at COI in order to source information handling principles.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Complete.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Action 6</strong>: Simon Denison to produce a contacts list in advance of next meeting.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Not 			complete. Simon will ensure that it is sent with the minutes.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>3. Update on meeting between HM Courts and Tribunals Service and Central News regarding availability of courts listings and results information</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Martin 	Jones (ex-head of Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service 	(HMCTS) Crown Court business) stated that following the meeting on 3 	November 2011 he wrote to London court managers and asked them to be 	mindful of HMCTS guidance regarding provision of information. He 	also stated at the meeting it is important the provision of 	information does not impede court business and that bespoke 	information is not feasible due to operational constraints. He 	acknowledged that administrative data systems were often not helpful 	in this regard and that HMCTS is looking into providing more 	criminal court listings information, such as offence charged. 	However he was careful to say this was only feasibility testing at 	present. Iain Bell was keen to point out that significant technical 	and practical challenges remain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will 	Perrin asked whether listings and results information could be 	posted on the internet and be freely available  to the public rather 	than just journalists. He was concerned that open justice was a 	non-codified principle of the justice system that had to compete 	with a range of codified constraints such as data protection and 	copyright legislation and the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act. He 	thought compiling a stratified list of constraints would be a useful 	exercise to encourage open justice at the local level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Francis 	Davey encouraged the panel to remember civil cases, and that 	listings data for these was often behind a paywall. He asked if 	listings information can be posted on the wall of a court, why can’t 	it just be posted on the internet?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simon 	Denison advised that HMCTS were looking at the feasibility of 	providing more information on criminal court listings but that new 	data were not likely to be available in the short term.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>4. Delivery of police.uk and implications for data developers</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Dan 	Lewis (Economic Policy Centre) talked to a paper on his work to 	produce a crime data aggregator site, his concerns on the delivery 	of Police.uk and its effect on the developer community in the 	sector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dan 	outlined a number of concerns:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Releasing 			raw data quickly does not encourage an open data economy due to 			the time needed to clean the data before re-use. The need for 			points of interest to match up between different geo-location 			datasets was also raised (e.g. Garmin versus Ordnance Survey).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developer 			numbers in the crime sector are decreasing over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 			release of a free Police.uk app impacted significantly on the 			private sector market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A 			lack of data governance by forces – different recording systems 			made data re-use difficult.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 			silent changing of files (e.g. changing location details) made 			sustainable use of the data problematic. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Police.uk 			is prejudicial to a thriving open data economy as it represents a 			vertically integrated monopoly. This will be compounded with the 			release of justice outcome information in May.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rock 			Kitchen Harris (the police.uk contractor) accrues an unfair 			competitive advantage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Police.uk 			receives unfair political endorsement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 			British Transport Police (BTP) data on Police.uk is incomplete in 			its raw form, making it impossible to replicate for developers.</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>In 	summary, Dan thought that private-sector crime data developers 	should be allowed to thrive in an open, free and competitive 	environment, unimpeded by unfair competition with government 	websites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will 	Perrin stated that innovative uses of data frequently came from the 	private sector and gave the example of the cricinfo site versus 	bbc.co.uk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iain 	Bell raised the example of the ASBarometer site that had been 	developed to show the location of Anti-Social Behaviour incidents, 	but that was not updated following the lead developer moving to a 	different job. Iain contended that Government has a duty to supply a 	certain level of information, but that there was a balance to be 	struck. He was happy to work with Dan in the run-up to justice 	outcome information being released on Police.uk, and said he is 	looking to enable pre-release access to justice outcome information 	for developers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Andrew 	Watson responded on the BTP point. He stated that the different 	funding model for BTP compared to territorial forces (by train 	companies rather than Government) raised significant sensitivity in 	releasing crime data and that footfall data raised issues of 	commercial sensitivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Janet 	Hughes asked that the Rock Kitchen Harris contract be publically 	released and whether there had been a lessons learned exercise 	undertaken that could inform the next Police.uk contract.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Action: Adam Thompson to discuss with the Home Office and National Policing Improvement Agency whether the contract could be released.</p>
<p>Action: Adam Thompson to examine the possibility of holding a lessons learned exercise on the delivery of Police.uk to date.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Francis 	Davey pointed out that with the release of useable data innovative 	apps can be developed and then used by the public sector, such as 	Fix my Street, and that this retains a primary role for the private 	sector in promoting innovation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dan 	suggested the following next steps:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The 			Home Office (HO) should not duplicate existing capabilities of 			UKCrimeStats or any other 3rd party crime data developer;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not 			integrate crime and justice outcomes into police.uk, rather give 			3rd party developers a chance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No 			further developments of police.uk and other similar sites – only 			publish monthly crime data updates;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Police.uk 			mobile app to be discontinued;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All 			existing datasets used by Government sponsored crime websites be 			made available to all developers and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set 			a date to stop updating police.uk thereby enabling other 			developers to blossom. </p>
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><ol type="i"><li> 
<ul><li>
<p>Allan 		Brimicombe contributed by saying that wards (a common category in 		crime data) are too big, and that crimes are mapped to the centre 		of streets even though boundaries are often located there: both of 		these make meaningful analysis difficult, especially in high crime 		areas.</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
</ol><p><strong>6. Crime and Justice Transparency Strategy </strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Kieron 	O’Hara referred panel members to the draft strategy document. The 	paper sets out an approach to driving greater transparency across 	the justice system, including progress to date, our future approach, 	potential areas of work and key challenges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 	aim is to deliver the most effective and transparent justice system 	in the world. The launch of Police.uk already gives access to 	street-level crime and anti-social behaviour data, and HO/MoJ will 	be publishing justice outcome information on Police.uk in May, but 	there is an ambition to move further than this. Data will continue 	to be available in an open and standardised format to enable 	developers, the private sector and the public to make use of it in 	innovative ways. There are plans to move to a ‘demand led’ 	approach of publishing information and engage with data experts and 	users to release data which enables communities to shape the 	delivery of local services and make them truly accountable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kieron 	O’Hara had a number of comments. The first was to ensure that the 	full range of data users is borne in mind as the current conception 	was too narrow; he also recommended liasing with the newly-formed 	Open Data Institute in this regard. He also mentioned the need to 	retain operational independence of datasets where there was a 	demonstrated advantage in doing so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Janet 	Hughes also thought that more was needed on stakeholder analysis as 	the strategy focused excessively on developers to the exclusion of 	other people who might want to use the data, including scrutineers 	and researchers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allan 	Brimicombe warned against confusing interest with impact, and also 	asked whether public feedback will be acted on transparently. He 	also asked whether business cases would be published when complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will 	Perrin thought the strategy was too upbeat on the current situation, 	and that the potential work to publish judges’ remarks more widely 	would run into issues of copyright. Francis Davey advised there was 	provision for privately-owned information to be re-used publicly 	under current copyright law (e.g. Companies’ House data). Will 	also thought the objectives should explicitly state that improved 	justice outcomes was an aim of the transparency agenda.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iain 	Bell stated that MoJ data can’t ever be truly open but that there 	is plenty of room for making it more open. He was also keen to have 	work on improving data sharing more visible in the strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jonathan 	Bamford thought the paper should explicitly state that transparency 	does not want to impede markets and doesn’t want to undermine 	confidence in the CJS. He was keen to state that data protection law 	should not be used as shorthand for a range of other public policy 	issues such as rehabilitation of offenders and the protection of 	freedoms bill. He also pointed out that fears around privacy in 	relation to Police.uk were still in existence even if actions had 	been put in place to mitigate them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Andrew 	Watson followed on data protection law – data protection should 	not be a reason not to do something, but just required a robust 	process of risk analysis and acceptance where they could not be 	fully mitigated. He also commented on the impact on victims of 	street-level crime data. </p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>7. Update on Justice outcome mapping on police.uk </strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Adam 	Thompson updated the panel on work to deliver justice outcome 	information on Police.uk in May. He mentioned the need to understand 	the proportion of crimes being dealt with at each stage. The 	majority of reported crimes will have no resolution as in 72% of 	cases, following investigation there is insufficient evidence to 	bring an offender to justice; a further 12% receive a caution, local 	resolution etc. About 16% of reported crimes make it into the court 	system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outcomes 	will be anonymised to protect privacy and the data will be published 	in a re-useable format as well as being displayed on Police.uk. 	Currently, it is expected that about 60% of reported crimes that 	proceed to court can be matched to an outcome, although this varies 	significantly between areas and is improving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 	Home Office is working with police forces to improve the matching 	rate. HO and MoJ are also developing a communications plan which 	includes information on the methodology, matching process, and 	contextual information that will be provided. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There 	are plans to evaluate how the public are using the crime and justice 	data provided via Police.uk in order to inform future developments. 	Panel members discussed the fact that some forces are more advanced 	than others which could lead to inconsistency in data recording if 	some crimes are not linked to an outcome. </p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>8. Broadcasting court proceedings </strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Liz 	Eaton provided an update on the Government’s position on 	broadcasting of court proceedings. She stated the Justice 	Secretary’s decision to legislate to allow broadcasting from 	courts, starting with the Court of Appeal with a view to moving to 	the Crown court at a later date. She advised that primary 	legislation is required, and that the protection of victims and 	witnesses would be paramount., especially when broadcasting is 	rolled out in the Crown court. She also advised that technical and 	operational issues are being discussed by MoJ, HMCTS and the 	Judiciary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will 	Perrin raised the issue of copyright of video broadcast and who 	would have ownership rights. He also mentioned that local television 	stations should have free access to the footage as the cost of 	purchase could restrict wider access. </p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>9. Any Other Business</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Francis 	Davey asked how interested parties could intiate a discussion around 	the release of data sets for their use. Simon Denison advised that 	contact should be made with him.   </p>
</li>
</ul>
