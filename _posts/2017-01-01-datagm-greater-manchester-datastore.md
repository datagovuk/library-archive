<p><strong>DataGM - Greater Manchester Datastore</strong></p>
<p><em>DataGM was launched in February 2011 by the public sector organisations in Greater Manchester, to release and bring together in one place, as much of the data they hold as possible.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In November 2009 <a href="http://futureeverything.org/" rel="nofollow">FutureEverything</a> was funded by the Manchester Innovation Fund (NESTA, Manchester Council, NWDA) to establish a sustainable Open Data Innovation (ODI) ecology in Greater Manchester. FutureEverything operated from a neutral position outside local government, whereas Open Data development has been led in most cities by the Mayor’s office.</p>
<p><a href="http://datagm.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">DataGM</a> was launched in February 2011 by the public sector organisations in Greater Manchester, to release and bring together in one place, as much of the data they hold as possible. Data includes public sector spending across Greater Manchester, transport, location and crime data. Its data has been used to map <a href="/library/Mapnificent" rel="nofollow">travel times</a> the location of <a href="/library/Trafford-Polling-Stations" rel="nofollow">polling stations</a> to support local elections and many other <a href="/library/Manchester-Amenity-Maps" rel="nofollow">amenities</a>.</p>
<p>DataGM involves collaboration across all 10 local authorities in Greater Manchester, FutureEverything and Open Data Manchester – an open data community, which meets regularly, has an active web presence, and that has created applications profiled in the national press.  DataGM is driven by the belief that Open Data has the potential to make Greater Manchester more equitable through equal data access so long as people have the tools and the ability to act. </p>
<p>DataGM is coordinated by <a href="/library/InfoTrafford" rel="nofollow">Trafford Council</a> and is linked to the wider Open Data Cities programme.  In Manchester advocacy work includes thematic hackdays in association with Manchester Digital Development Agency, links with FutureEverything conference and festival and via the FutureEverything Data Literacy programme, an EU part-funded Smart Cities project.</p>
