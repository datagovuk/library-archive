<p>Part of the Data Portal Quick-Setup Guides being compiled by the data.gov.uk team. The aim is to provide quick, introductory documentation on the process of setting up a data portal for government.<br />
These are being created under an iterative project, with new versions being produced as new content is available, mainly derived from our conversations with other governments about what issues they face in setting up their data portals, as such, this can be considered living documents, formal drafts that will evolve with time.<br />
They are provided in PDF format because it is aimed at civil servants across the world, who may not be able to use an on-screen version and will need a print-formatted copy. As time passes, we will bring the contents of the guides into a wiki structure with downloads also available on the side.</p>
