<p>Complete.</p>
<p><strong>3.  Transparency Programme Update</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Delivery of Commitments</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>The Cabinet Office is developing a departmental scorecard for the delivery of open data commitments which will be given a RAG rating.</li>
<li>It would also look at engagement between departments and the centre.</li>
<li>The scorecards would be agreed with departments and published in a written Ministerial statement from the Minister for Cabinet Office.</li>
<li>The scorecard would cover the period to the end of March 2012.</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Open Data Strategies</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>In line with the delivery of the departmental business plans, there is now a longer lead time to deliver Open Data Strategies.</li>
<li>The final sign off by departments will need to happen by 25th May</li>
<li>The Cabinet Office will publish all the Open Data Strategies as part of the Right to Data White Paper where they will be included as a link.</li>
<li>It is expected that departments will also publish their strategies. This would most easily be done via a link on their websites to data.gov.uk. </li>
<li>The Department of Health is also publishing an Information Strategy.</li>
<li>The Open Data Strategies will allow departments to set out what data they have and when they plan to publish it.</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Data.gov.uk</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>Data.gov.uk will be re-launched in June as part of the White Paper announcement.</li>
<li>Antonio Acuna, Head of data.gov.uk, is working with the Transparency Practitioners’ Group to ensure that departmental contacts are kept up to date.</li>
<li>The Transparency Team is doing an audit of the quality of meta-data.</li>
<li>They are also developing a better input model (metadata) as part of the improvements to the entire user experience.</li>
<li>The Senior Officials asked if there were performance metrics for data.gov.uk that could be shared. There is currently a limit to the type of performance metrics that can be derived from data.gov.uk.</li>
<li>The statistics that can currently be derived from data.gov.uk show that ‘health’ is the most popular tag, that the average number of unique visitors to the site is 25,000 per month and approximately 15,000 users return to the site per month.</li>
<li>The Transparency Team would provide for the next meeting details of metrics and analytics currently available from data.gov.uk to inform discussion on what would be useful going forward</li>
<li>The forward looking list of data publications to be provided in the Open Data Strategies would, alongside data currently published, begin to form a data inventory. This would then be compared with details provided for the HM Treasury Data Review undertaken in 2010 and the inventory further developed in light of that.  A data inventory would allow a measurement against volume for each department. However, it was clearly recognised departments could not be compared to each other with such data; they each produce different levels and quantities of data. There needs to be a strategic sense of what could and should be included in the data inventories and whether there is a potential to charge for certain datasets.</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Open Data Institute</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>The business plan for the Open Data Institute was submitted to the Technology Strategy Board for assessment by independent assessors at the start of April. An approval letter is expected on 4th May.</li>
<li>The delay in receipt of the offer letter means that the implementation plan will not be published in April 2012, as originally planned in the Autumn Statement.</li>
<li>Nigel Shadbolt is planning to engage with the private and public sectors over the coming months to discuss and explore plans for the Open Data Institute. An event for public sector leaders is being planned for 22 May to which the SOG members would be invited.</li>
<li>One of the early projects for the Open Data Institute would be to conduct research into the economic evidence base for transparency and open data.</li>
<li>The official launch for the Open Data Institute is planned for the autumn.</li>
<li>The Senior Officials asked questioned the relationship between the Open Data Institute and the What Works Institute. This will be clarified.</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Open for Business</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>The Open for Business Forum is a collaboration between the Cabinet Office and the Private Sector. It is chaired by Philip N Green.</li>
<li>The remit of the Open for Business Forum includes looking at corporate responsibility, such as data related to the development of employees, to the benefit of community.</li>
<li>The first meeting of the Advisory Group is on 1st May. This will be chaired by Philip N Green and consist of a mixture of public and private sector. </li>
<li>A practitioners group, chaired by Tim Kelsey, will convene on 16th May. This group will identify what datasets should be included and develop a high level strategy for looking at corporate responsibility.</li>
<li>A pilot will start in July.</li>
<li>The Cabinet Office has asked departments for details of what corporate responsibility data, if any, it collects from its suppliers. The Home Office, HMRC and MOD all collect a limited amount of this type of data. </li>
<li>This initiative is part of a move towards Open Britain.</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Open Government Partnership</em></strong></p>
<ul><li>The Open Government Partnership (OGP) is a voluntary partnership between governments and Civil Society Organisations, encouraging a ‘race to the top’ for Transparency, and also looking to combat corruption.</li>
<li>It was launched in September 2011 with eight original founding members, including the UK. </li>
<li>The first annual OGP conference happened in April with 55 member states. It signified the start of the UK’s co-chairmanship, for an 18 month period. </li>
<li>The Cabinet Office, Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Department for International Development are leading on this initiative. UKTI and the Ministry of Justice are also closely involved.</li>
<li>To be a member of the OGP, states need to demonstrate a minimum level of transparency. </li>
<li>There will be a number of events over the next year and the UK will host the next annual event in spring 2013. </li>
<li>Work is currently underway on the UK’s strategy for its period of co-chairmanship.</li>
<li>Not many European countries are members of the OGP. The Senior Officials felt that the UK should help other European states get involved.</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Action:</em></strong></p>
<p>-          <strong><em>Cabinet Office and Senior Officials’ to discuss metrics and management information at a future meeting.</em></strong></p>
<p>-          <strong><em>Senior Officials to discuss the approach to data inventories at a future meeting, through a workshop session.</em></strong></p>
<p>-          <strong><em>Transparency Team to clarify the relationship between the Open Data Institute and the What Works Institute.</em></strong></p>
<p>-          <strong><em>Transparency Team to circulate the diplomatic note of the Open Government Partnership conference.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>4.  Right to Data White Paper (Taken as first item)</strong></p>
<ul><li>Simon French provided an update on the progress of the Right to Data White Paper.</li>
<li>Simon reassured the group that data sharing would be a single component part of the White Paper.</li>
<li>The White Paper will be limited in what it can propose on the policy for data sharing given existing legislation. Data sharing will be promoted through the legal frameworks.</li>
<li>Francis Maude is very keen that the narrative is strongly worded and pro-data sharing.</li>
<li>A draft of the White Paper will be sent to Francis Maude on Friday 27th April.</li>
<li>The draft will also be circulated to the working group and the Senior Officials’ Group.</li>
<li>The Department of Health is undertaking an independent review of confidentiality and consent. The approach will need to be coordinated with the Cabinet Office run activity.</li>
<li>The Transparency Team are exploring with the Cabinet Office economists the most appropriate way to assess impact.</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Action:</em></strong></p>
<p>-          <strong><em>Transparency Team to circulate the draft of the Right to Data White Paper to the Senior Officials’ Group.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Open Data User Group</strong></p>
<ul><li> The Public Data Group (PDG) has brought together the trading funds:
<ul><li>Met Office</li>
<li>Land Registry</li>
<li>Ordnance Survey</li>
<li>Companies House</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Data Strategy Board (DSB) is the commissioning body for open data. It will commission data from the PDG. The DSB has £7million to be spent over two years with the PDG.</li>
<li>The Open Data User Group (ODUG) will be the central focus for the open data community at large enabling them to discuss what data should be released and shared. The ODUG chair will represent these views on the DSB.</li>
<li>Much of what could be released and shared will be proposed through the Sector Boards but the ODUG will help the discussion of what data should be prioritised when proposing requests to the DSB. There will be other voices in the ODUG, such as developers, who may wish for very specific datasets to be released.</li>
<li>Candidates for the ODUG chair will be interviewed on the 2nd ad 4th May</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Action:</em></strong></p>
