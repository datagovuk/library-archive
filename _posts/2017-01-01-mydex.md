<p><strong>Mydex</strong></p>
<p><em>Mydex are a British social-enterprise helping to make it easier and safer for individuals to hold, control, and re-use their personal information in effective and secure ways.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Until now the personal data used for online services has almost without exception been controlled by large organisations, typically businesses and government. This can leave people uncertain about what happens to their personal data.  <a href="http://mydex.org/" rel="nofollow">Mydex</a> CIC is a British social-enterprise which showed earlier this year, working with Cabinet Office, DWP, local authorities and leading businesses, how individuals could securely control their own information, have it externally verified, and then share it under the individual's control with companies and public services.</p>
<p>Secure personal data services such as Mydex are designed to offer a radical and practical way of improving relationships with individual customers, cleaning up data and opening up a whole range of new services, based on consumer preference and intent. It provides the protection necessary for a ‘digital by default’ approach, and supports a participative approach to online public services such as in health, employment and education.As business and government starts to release personal data back to individuals, this new breed of personal data service will let individuals acquire, manage and make the best of their data giving them better choice, control and privacy and driving economic growth.</p>
