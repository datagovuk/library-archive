<p><strong>Salford Lung Study</strong></p>
<p><em>The Salford Lung Study shows how voluntary data-sharing by individuals can revolutionise healthcare research, making it more convenient and more effective.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.gsk.com/uk/" rel="nofollow">GlaxoSmithKline</a>, <a href="http://www.nweh.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">North West e-Health</a>, <a href="http://www.manchester.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">University of Manchester</a>, <a href="http://www.srft.nhs.uk/" rel="nofollow">Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust</a>, <a href="http://www.salford.nhs.uk/" rel="nofollow">NHS Salford</a>, local GPs and pharmacists have created a collaborative study on investigative medicines for treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma.</p>
<p>4,000 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 5,000 with asthma enrolled in a year-long study (subject to the usual regulatory and ethical requirements for traditional clinical trials) using a linked database system - a global first for a large <em>“real-world”</em> study performed on pre-licence medicine across a large population in a single geographical location - was created using real-time, integrated data collected from a variety of resources, including Salford’s E-Health records infrastructure which provides a single, integrated electronic patient records across primary and secondary care.</p>
<p>Traditional randomised medical trials focus on the safety and efficacy of investigational medicines, and while highly valuable these studies are highly controlled and enrol a more selected patient population that is not always reflective of the population that would be prescribed the drug. This linked database allows patients to be closely monitored to the minimum standards required for traditional clinical trials over the course of the study, but removes the need for ‘artificial’ interventions. This improves medicine development through understanding how medicines are used by patients outside of a strictly controlled trial and thus help decision makers evaluate the true value, benefits and potential at an earlier stage, in turn this will help patients to access new medicines where appropriate.</p>
