<p>This guide is largely based on an analysis of validation failures when metadata validation was first run on the location records that had already been collected into data.gov.uk. Approximately half the records present in data.gov.uk at that time initially failed.</p>
<p>This guide assumes that the reader is familiar with the creation and management of location discovery metadata. </p>
