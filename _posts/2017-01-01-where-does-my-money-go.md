<p><a href="http://wheredoesmymoneygo.org/" rel="nofollow">Where Does My Money Go?</a> aims to promote transparency and citizen engagement through the analysis and visualisation of information about UK public spending.  First started in 2007, the project went on to win the UK Government’s <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100402134053/showusabetterway.com/" rel="nofollow">‘Show Us a Better Way’</a> competition in November 2008, was developed further with a small Government grant in 2009 and the site received funding from Channel 4’s <a href="http://channel4.com/programmes/4ip" rel="nofollow">4iP</a> to support further development in 2010.  The site uses COINS data and departmental spend over £25,000 datasets released in 2010.</p>
<p>Run by the <a href="http://okfn.org/" rel="nofollow">Open Knowledge Foundation</a>, a not-for-profit network of advocates for open knowledge, government and society, Where Does My Money Go? is part of a wider project tracking use of public funds – <a href="http://openspending.org/" rel="nofollow">Open Spending</a>. </p>
