<p><a href="http://www.flyingbinary.com/" rel="nofollow">FlyingBinary</a> is an SME that provides data analytics and Cloud computing solutions and services. The two company founders have over 40 years of experience working on large public and private sectors programmes.  They created the company in 2009 to help give organisations best of breed in new technologies.</p>
<p>FlyingBinary has recently been accredited on the G-Cloud Services Framework, which they believe is a major opportunity to bring to the public sector the same rapid, low-cost analytics and Business Intelligence used by industry.  FlyingBinary has also worked with the Guardian on several public data visualisation projects, and has provided proof of concept visualisations for a number of Government Departments using the COINS data.</p>
<p>FlyingBinary believes that the G-Cloud, social media and Open Data movements are just the start of a social and technological transformation.  Co-founder, Jacqui Taylor, says <em>“we’re ready for the journey.”</em></p>
