<p><strong>iCoast</strong></p>
<p><em>iCoast is an online, electronic map of the Dorset Coast, helping people plan their visits in a safe and sustainable way.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.icoast.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">iCoast</a> is produced by the Dorset Coast Forum and part of the C-COPE (combining sea and coastal planning in Europe) project funded by the EU and a number of UK organisations. The key aims are to ensure that the coast and sea around Dorset is used sustainably while boosting the marine and coastal economy.</p>
<p>iCoasts mapping uses Ordinance Survey VectorMap District, to create their own background map with its own distinct style. At other scales the site uses mapping from <a href="http://www.data.gov.uk/library/Ordnance-Survey-Open-Data" rel="nofollow">OS OpenSpace</a>.</p>
<p>For locations, ADDRESS-POINT data is used to accurately locate businesses exact locations. In addition iCoast aggregates and data from <em>Travelines</em> service to provide bus information, aerial photography from  Dorset County Council, local amateur weather data, information about cycle routes and path from <em>Sustrans</em>, and many other useful data from local councils, the marine conservation society and the Royal Yachting Association, and incorporates them into the map.</p>
<p>Thus iCoast allows visitors to find interesting things to see and do, provides practical information about transport links, weather forecasts and location of visitor centres. Codes of conduct are attached to all the activities so that visitors can use the Dorest Coast safely and sustainably.</p>
