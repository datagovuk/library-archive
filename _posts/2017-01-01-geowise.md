<p><strong>Geowise</strong></p>
<p><em>Geowise enables organisations to present large volumes of often complex public sector data in an easy-to-understand visual format using its InstantAtlas software.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Edinburgh-based <a href="http://www.instantatlas.com/" rel="nofollow">Geowise</a> produces InstantAtlas, software which enables organisations to present large volumes of often complex data in an easy-to-understand visual format using its InstantAtlas software. Users can publish online dynamic reports, with links between charts, tables, maps that bring together data about local areas and populations. InstantAtlas reports can placed on a web site, in a content management system, made available for download, sent by email or distributed on CD. These reports can be also be exported as PDFs for inclusion in presentations and written documents.</p>
<p>A wide range of national and international commercial, public and voluntary sector organisations use InstantAtlas to visualise and display data. These include: Public Health Observatories, local councils and healthcare commissioners. In the UK it has been used by (amongst others) Trafford Council to build <a href="http://www.data.gov.uk/library/InfoTrafford" rel="nofollow">InfoTrafford</a>.</p>
