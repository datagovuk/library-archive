<p><strong>Health iQ</strong></p>
<p><em>Health iQ is an analytics consultancy that works across healthcare and life sciences, who helped Healthcare for London to develop a specialist stroke service.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://healthiq.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Health iQ</a>, is a data science and health economics consultancy, which works with partners across healthcare and life sciences, including Clinical Commissioning Groups, NHS Trusts and pharmaceuticals.  Combing cutting-edge technology and in-house software development, Health iQ creates value from modelling, simulating, visualising and analysing data.</p>
<p>In 2008, a joint committee of primary care trusts agreed to a proposal by Healthcare for London to develop a specialist stroke service across London. This was composed of three distinct services; Hyper-Acute Stroke Units for immediate response, with all Londoners able to be able to obtain ambulance access to the units within 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Health iQ combined data from the London Ambulance Services with postcode-level geographic data modelled using Geographic Information System software to identify the minimum number and optimum location of sites required to achieve access for the entire population of London. Innovative use of public data sets made this complex task achievable with relative ease, helping to facilitate equal access for all Londoners to a hyper-acute stroke unit and improve the standard of response to stroke victims in the capital.</p>
